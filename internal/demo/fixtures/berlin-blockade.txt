The Four Power struggle for Germany has become—temporarily at least—less sharp. After weeks of negotiation in Moscow, agreement has been reached upon a possible procedure for ending the blockade of Berlin and agreed instructions have been sent to the four Commanders-in-Chief in Berlin, requiring them to work out a formula whereby, under Four Power control, the Soviet mark could become Berlin’s currency. If agreement is reached, the blockade will presumably be raised and this in turn may pave the way for a new meeting of the Foreign Ministers to discuss the whole future of Germany.

The negotiations in Berlin will be involved and may not be conclusive. The Russians wish to raise the question not only of the issue of currency but of the control of credit and it will tax the Western Powers’ ingenuity to the utmost to discover methods of making their control effective and of preventing discrimination against the Western Sectors of Berlin. The Russians are probably in no hurry to conclude an agreement since each day’s delay brings them nearer to the completion of harvesting in the Eastern zone while to the Allies it only brings the threat of November weather to the airlift. Agreement may be reached in Berlin, but it may be followed by weeks of further negotiation in Moscow.

What then? Suppose that the blockade were lifted, would the underlying Four Power struggle be resolved? Are the Allies on the verge of a solid settlement or are they witnessing no more than a change of hand-hold as the Russian wrestlers prepare a new move? Berlin itself gives no answer to this question, since Berlin is only one element in the wider struggle for Germany and it must be confessed that if the Four Power dispute is examined in its wider context, the latest developments in Berlin look more like a change of manoeuvre than a change of heart. ■
