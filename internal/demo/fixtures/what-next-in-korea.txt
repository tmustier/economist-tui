December 27th has come and gone and nothing has been settled, nothing changed. The temporary truce in Korea continues, with the obvious implication that the battle-line of November 27th will still be an acceptable basis for an armistice if ever an armistice becomes possible. It would hardly be otherwise from the point of view of the United Nations Command, which fought and argued for weeks to get the line accepted and which, since no action to alter it materially has been undertaken, is presumably now fully satisfied. But there does not seem to be any very clear notion in Washington how long the negotiations will go on, or how long they should be allowed to go on, if they continue to make as little progress as they have so far.

What to do next must be the most important item on the agenda in the Truman-Churchill talks. As the fateful day approached, the mood of the United States became almost truculent and support grew for the policy of coupling agreement to an armistice on the present line with formal threats of what would be done to the Chinese mainland if the armistice line were crossed. Through all the discussion there has run a thread of irritation with the United Nations, and particularly with those members who have forces in Korea; in some unexplained way, it is felt, they are impeding the United States from achieving a clear-cut decision.

Now that 1952 is here it is important, from the point of view of domestic politics, not only to put an end to the casualties but also to start bringing the boys back home victorious before long. Otherwise the Republicans will have a splendid case against a Democratic party which knows how to get the country into war but does not know how to get it out again. ■
