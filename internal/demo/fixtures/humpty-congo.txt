The Congolese—and everyone else—may have learned something from the past year’s jigsaw operation. All the world’s horses and all the world’s men may yet succeed in putting the Congo together again. The prime task of the United Nations in the past year has been to guard against ambitious countries pulling the infant state apart in attempts to acquire bits of it for themselves. This task has now been carried out, except perhaps in parts of the province of Katanga. But the threat to international peace thus averted must not be allowed to arise again.

If the Congolese freely decided to pull their country apart and divide the bits among themselves, that would be their affair. But it becomes the world’s affair when each section of a country calls on different allies abroad for help, or when a recognised central government is threatened with revolt by a province that draws military support from outside. This is why the UN’s job is now more subtly difficult than ever.

The UN has patiently guided the Congolese back from the looking-glass world of battles by press conference and private armies. Now, at last, there is hope of achieving a modest degree of stability. On August 2nd the Congolese parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new prime minister, Mr Cyrille Adoula, a moderate socialist and a supporter of a strong unitary form of government. ■
