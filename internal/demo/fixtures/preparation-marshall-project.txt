The July issue of Foreign Affairs, analysing “Sources of Soviet Conduct,” argues that with the principle of infallibility of the Kremlin and party discipline, “the leadership is at liberty to put forward for tactical purposes any particular thesis which it finds useful to the cause at any particular moment.” When Mr Molotov answered his own question on the Marshall project—“What then would remain of the economic independence and sovereignty of such European countries?”—he illustrated this generalisation and lifted a moral load off the American mind.

Americans have been sensitive to charges of imperialism. They have believed that American foreign policy ought to support the assurances of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and have repeatedly sought extenuating circumstances for apparent obstructionism. But when Mr Molotov wrapped himself in the mantle of Mr Wilson and championed the right to self‑determination of small nations, the American reaction was, “Tell me another.” Even the try‑hards have come to certain conclusions about Russia.

Now that this point has been reached, what next? One alternative is to stress that One World came to an end on July 2nd. The other is to concentrate on the vitality of the European economy, going ahead with however many countries will go ahead. That approach requires an analysis of European capacities and of the commodities and services—coal, steel, power, transportation—required for renewed production, as well as the mechanisms of management that can make or break the transfer from paper estimates to three‑dimensional operations. ■
