For its forty-year celebrations on Wednesday the Supreme Soviet moved its quarters from the Kremlin to a Moscow sports stadium. The festivities were not to be spoilt by the removal of Marshal Zhukov from all the leading party bodies announced over the week-end. Mr Khrushchev, who once again delivered the main speech, had other subjects to boast about. With the super-sputnik in its orbit, he could talk with pride of Soviet achievements.

Having poked some fun at the Americans—whom he invited to send their “Vanguard” to chase the sputniks—Mr Khrushchev turned to the West with an appeal for “high level talks between representatives of capitalist and socialist countries,” a meeting at which the great problems of world politics could be peacefully solved. He emphasised the particular importance of a Soviet-American understanding, throwing out the assurance that this would not be “damaging to the interests of America’s allies.”

The Soviet peace offensive now seems to be proceeding on three different levels. In the United Nations, it is urged, disarmament must be taken out of the hands of the small committee, and made the subject of a palaver for all. Simultaneously, a more select group should meet at a higher level. Finally, the two greatest powers should bargain at the very summit. How good, sighed Mr Khrushchev in one passage, if resources could be shifted from defence to consumption. At which of these three levels will the Soviet government make concrete proposals to translate this unexceptionable aspiration into fact? ■
