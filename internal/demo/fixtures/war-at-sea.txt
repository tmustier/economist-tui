The first blow of the war struck on the water was a sensational one. At about 9 o’clock on Sunday evening the Athenia, a ship of 15,000 tons belonging to the Donaldson Line, with 1,400 passengers on board, was torpedoed by a submarine, which could only be German, and sunk. No warning was given by the assailant, but at the time of going to press it seems that, apart from those killed by the explosion, the majority of those who took to the boats have been picked up by various ships.

Apart from the fact that more than 300 American citizens were on board, the outrage to the Athenia—the submarine’s procedure was quite contrary to the international rules governing such attacks and subscribed to by the Third Reich—served to underline the urgency of putting a full and effective convoy system into operation. This is being done by the Admiralty with all speed.

Meanwhile, a number of smaller British vessels have been sunk, while certain German merchantmen have been captured or, in cases where they were capable of being converted for use as armed raiders, destroyed. Thus, Britain’s command of the seas takes the first strain of the conflict in the West. ■
