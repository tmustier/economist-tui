Major Yuri Gagarin’s brave venture on Wednesday established a date that will certainly appear in the history books of the future. The Soviet team that shot Major Gagarin round the world in 90 minutes, at a height varying between 100 and 200 miles, has virtually got him out of the atmosphere, the element within which the human destiny had formerly seemed to be confined. Vast though the distances of space are, the escape from the atmosphere, even by a relatively negligible margin, is an achievement full of significance.

While we cannot perceive the ultimate consequences, we can foresee that they will be, in every sense of the world, far-reaching. There is plenty of real, as well as official jubilation now in Moscow. If it has a strong chauvinistic tinge, that is a regrettably normal circumstance, familiar not only from the time of the launching of the first sputnik but also from those of the ascent of Everest, the crossing of Antarctica, and the Olympics of recent years. But, for several reasons, the impact of the new feat on world opinion as a whole is unlikely to prove as dramatic as that of the first sputnik.

Psychologically, and therefore politically, the first man in space ought to be a notable coup. But the successive marvels of the space age are already tending to yield diminishing moral returns. Even in the under-developed countries, now once more urged to acknowledge the superiority of the Soviet system, growing sophistication is bringing with it a suspicion that the lavishing of such resources on rocketry may indicate a failure to adjust priorities to mankind's real needs. ■
