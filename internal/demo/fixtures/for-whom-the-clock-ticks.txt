“Have you ever seen a saint wearing a watch?” Picasso once asked. Fortunately for Switzerland, most timebound sinners prize a Swiss watch above any other. Switzerland exports between 40 and 45 million watches and clocks a year, worth well over 1,100 million francs, and that trade contributes a substantial share of the country’s export earnings.

Yet the industry’s dominance has slipped: Switzerland’s share of the world market has fallen from 70 to 50 per cent as foreign manufacture grows. A new Watch Statute, replacing the strict regime of 1951, is intended to encourage the industry to march with the times while safeguarding quality.

The statute will liberalise production while imposing official technical controls to keep export standards high. Manufacturers must also contribute to scientific and technical research, particularly in electronics, as competition forces rationalisation and consolidation. The aim is to defend Switzerland’s reputation for the finest watches even as output and rivalry increase. ■
