After sitting to late hours during the past six weeks, the House of Lords has finished its labours on the Transport Bill. The Lords have carried out their work of review on this complicated Bill with despatch. It was sent to them after scamped discussion in Standing Committee; now it is returned usefully amended in detail but changed in certain fundamental clauses where the Opposition peers carried amendments against the Government by vote. Some of these changes seem wise, but others are more debatable. It is now for the Commons to decide whose will is to prevail.

There can be little doubt about the result—nor that the charge will be made that the House of Lords came dangerously near the line of interfering with the popular mandate, even if they did not cross it. This is not a very profitable line of discussion, for the Bill is highly technical and little understood by the people, and the amendments made to it have affected matters of technical detail and principle, not challenged outright the intention of the measure. The Bill, as Lord Addison claimed, is indeed a greatly improved measure, but not all of the Opposition amendments are “blemishes.”

The first amendment is a major improvement, to which the Government have sensibly agreed. This increases the size of the Transport Commission from five (including the chairman) to a maximum of nine, with at least five full-time members. The original number was dangerously small because members would have been loaded with departmental work and because only a miracle of selection could have produced five men of sufficient ability to make so small a body work. With nine members, the Commission should wield no less authority and should work more smoothly. ■
