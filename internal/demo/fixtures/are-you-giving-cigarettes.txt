The chief medical officer’s annual report has forthright things to say about lung cancer. In 1960 some 22,000 people died from it, and the lung‑cancer death rate in men now exceeds the tuberculosis rate of twenty years ago. Yet the public hardly bats an eyelid.

The report’s most striking facts come from Jersey, which has the highest lung‑cancer death rate for men in the world and an exceptionally high rate for women. There is no air‑pollution problem there, but tobacco consumption per head is the highest in the world; in 1957–59 no case of lung cancer was recorded in a non‑smoker.

No one claims heavy smoking is the sole cause, but no one can maintain that it is not an important cause of cancer. It is odd that people will martyr themselves to ban the bomb yet think nothing of offering their children cigarettes. ■
