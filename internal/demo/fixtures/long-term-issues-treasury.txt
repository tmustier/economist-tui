If it be an act of virtue in the modern economic world to worry as much about tomorrow’s inflation as about today’s recession, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Anderson, has displayed a virtue possibly unparalleled in the western world since the war. While five million unemployed cool their heels and about 30 per cent of the country’s productive capacity lies idle, Mr Anderson has not only stubbornly resisted a tax cut that would have increased the budget deficit, but has flown in the face of orthodoxy by issuing $1 billion worth of 27-year bonds. This was undeniably an act of great courage; whether it was foolhardy remains to be seen.

Of all the factors in his decision, the one that probably was uppermost has nothing to do with the recession; it is the annoying tendency of the average life of the securities that make up the public debt to shorten with the passage of time. To Mr Anderson it is imperative that more of the debt should be longer-term in order to make it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control a future inflation. When too much of the debt is short-term and refinancing operations must be frequent, the central bank has to relax its pressure on the money market on too many occasions in order to help out the Treasury. Another problem is the tendency of short-term debt to be absorbed by the banking system and to produce a liquidity that made it difficult, during the 1955–57 inflation, for the central bank to halt inflation by control of the supply of money alone.

The tentative conclusion of a recent joint report of the presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks is that the Treasury should probably give up all idea of using debt management as a counter-cyclical instrument, and should instead make efforts to issue long-term bonds in limited amounts whenever market conditions are propitious, regardless of the state of economic activity. Mr Anderson has followed this prescription. ■
