In the first four months of 1952, the sterling area’s gold and dollar reserves fell by $673 million; in the last eight months they rose by $184 million. In December itself they fell by $49 million, but this was a modest loss for a month which saw the payment of $181 million for the service of the four North American loans. Moreover, despite a decline in receipts from commodity arbitrage, the sterling area earned a surplus of $29 million with countries in the European Payments Union in December; this surplus will be settled next week by the receipt of another $574 million of gold and the deduction of another $244 million from Britain’s accumulated overdraft with the Union. There is, therefore, nothing in last month’s experience that suggests any slowing of the welcome flow of the tide of gold and dollars to the reserves.

But the recent recovery in the reserves has not been of the same order as that which followed devaluation in 1949 and which continued through the first year of the Korean war. There is no sign yet of any repetition of the soaring boom that carried the reserves up by some $2,500 million, to $3,867 million, in the twenty-one months between September 1949 and June 1951; nor of any commensurate rebound from the sickening fall that carried them down again by more than $2,200 million, to $1,662 million, in the following ten months. The rot has been stopped; the reserves are now rising; and talk—indeed something more than talk—of sterling convertibility is in the air. That is the achievement of 1952.

There are now two main factors that affect the sterling area’s current dollar balance: the course of its trade with Europe and the course of its trade with North America. The decline of $489 million in the reserves during 1952 as a whole was mainly due to an adverse trade balance with Europe. The sterling area paid out $489 million of gold to the European Payments Union in the first nine months of 1952, and recouped $213 million of it in the last three; but for the receipt of some $170 million from arbitrage transactions, the total gold loss to Europe in 1952 would have been well over $400 million. This drain to the EPU did not come to an end until the early autumn, when Europe began to feel the full impact of the import restrictions imposed by the overseas Commonwealth in the spring of 1952, as well as of those imposed earlier by the United Kingdom. ■
