A referendum campaign does not bring out the best in the Rhodesian character. The campaign which ended in Southern Rhodesia with a vote by about 60,000 Europeans and 6,500 Asians, Coloureds and Africans on the new constitutional proposals was by local admission the most acrimonious of them all. Worse still, the campaign has almost certainly done permanent damage to race relations, since Sir Edgar Whitehead’s United Federal party found itself fighting for votes on its right wing and spent virtually no time assuring Africans that they would have a larger share in a brighter future.

The Southern Rhodesian government had a good case to put to its European electorate, and Sir Edgar, with his pipe and his two pairs of thick glasses as professorial props, put it well. He silenced his critics by offering them an enlightening lecture rather than controversial oratory; he pleased his audience with gentle scorn of the British Government’s ignorance of their country.

With the referendum won, the party should give credit to him rather than to Sir Roy Welensky. Sir Edgar claimed that the proposals give Southern Rhodesia, a self-governing colony since 1923, virtual independence—about as much as is enjoyed by the states of Australia. He wiped away clauses requiring laws that technically discriminated against Africans to be submitted to the British Government, and extracted a convention that Westminster would never legislate on its own initiative unless the country was in palpable chaos. ■
