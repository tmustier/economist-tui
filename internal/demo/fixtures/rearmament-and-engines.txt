The Prime Minister said in the course of the defence debate last Wednesday that deliveries of modern aircraft are seriously behind the original programme, and he went on to announce that steps had been taken to advance the production of the newest types of fighters. The Vickers and Hawker fighters are due to come into production late this year, and orders for the new de Havilland and Gloster all-weather fighters will presumably be placed more rapidly than was first intended. His statement implied that much of the delay in re-arming the Air Force is due to the tardiness with which new types have been ordered in the past and to the smallness of those initial orders.

If super-priority speeds up the rate of aircraft production, other causes of delay that are today of secondary importance will have to be taken into account. A case in point is the production of aero engines. Progress during the past year gives no grounds for complacency. Had a shortage of labour in the Preston factory of English Electric not led to setbacks in the production of the Canberra bomber, deliveries of these aircraft to the RAF would almost certainly have been held up for want of engines.

The cause of delay in engine production lay rather in the shortage of certain important engine components produced for the most part by companies outside the aircraft industry. The critical components are the blades for engines with axial compressors, and production in 1952 has been limited entirely by the supply of compressor blades. ■
