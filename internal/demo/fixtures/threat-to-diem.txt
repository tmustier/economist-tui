The threat to the Diem government continues to deepen as communist guerrillas and regular North Vietnamese units, still holding the initiative, pass down the central highlands and fan out to the coast. Shaded war‑map zones of guerrilla influence now mark more than twenty areas of anti‑Diem “liberation”; most inhabitants are simply trying to avoid having their throats cut.

About a thousand are killed on both sides in some 250 skirmishes a month. A swelling penetration bulge in the jungles of Kontum, with unhindered access to Laos, could become an “independent state” inside South Vietnam. Conservative American estimates agree that the build‑up of the phantom invasion has doubled since the Laotian cease‑fire.

In Saigon, pavement cafés buzz with defeatist gossip and resentment over the Diem family’s privileges. The once‑popular trek to the beaches has dwindled, seaside villas stand empty, and kidnappers warn parents at Dalat. The conviction that the villages’ interests lie with anti‑communist forces is still receding. ■
