Britain’s loss of gold and dollars from the central reserves during the past three months has reached, if not surpassed, the worst expectations. The figures disclosed by the Chancellor last Monday have been received with relative calm by a general public lulled into false security by sheer familiarity with recurrent crises; but they have rudely shocked every competent observer. The gold and dollar deficit of the sterling area in the final quarter of 1951 amounted to $940 million, or £336 million, a frightening rate of drain exceeded only in the catastrophic year 1947, when Britain was running rapidly through the American credits.

In the third quarter of 1951, when a second-quarter surplus of $54 million was converted into a deficit of $638 million, Mr Gaitskell estimated that less than half the drain was attributable to underlying factors and implied that the fourth quarter would show a perceptible improvement. Yet the moderate improvement that occurred in November and December still leaves the deficit for those months at a monthly rate above that for the previous quarter—before counting in the $176 million that was paid at the year-end in service on the United States and Canadian post-war loans.

In the past quarter the reserves have fallen by $934 million (£334 million); this is by far the biggest quarterly loss that has ever been experienced. The loss in these three months has been very little less than the whole loss in the three worst years of post-war deficits, when the drain in 1947, 1948 and 1949 totalled $1,008 million. ■
