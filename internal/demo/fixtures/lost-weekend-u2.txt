The summit was not wrecked in Paris: that happened in the cumulative deterioration of Russo-American relations between the bringing down of the Powers U-2 near Sverdlovsk on May 1st and Mr Khrushchev’s private talks with General de Gaulle and Mr Macmillan last Sunday. If the contention is accepted that Mr Khrushchev seized on the Powers case to break off at the summit, then American policy in this period cannot be said to suggest any serious intention of stopping him.

Mr Khrushchev’s successive statements gave the United States an opportunity to take the sting out of the Powers incident, although on progressively less satisfactory terms. Initially, Mr Khrushchev offered Mr Eisenhower the chance to dissociate himself from the activities of Powers’s immediate employers. On May 11th Mr Eisenhower specifically refused to do this: an act suggesting unusual political morality, but not diplomatic foresight.

Yet on the afternoon of May 12th, when Moscow lifted its own news blackout on Mr Khrushchev's press conference at the exhibition of the wrecked U-2, it was still feasible for western policy to be based on the supposition that the Soviet leadership had not resolved on an open break with the United States. The danger signals were painfully obvious. The initial sophistication of Mr Khrushchev’s reaction to the Powers case was wearing very thin. But there was still no sign from Washington of awareness that the American position might cause misapprehension, either in Moscow or elsewhere. ■
