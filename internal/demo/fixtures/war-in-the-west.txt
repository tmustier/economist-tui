On the Western Front the French Army has begun operations and made limited progress towards Saarbruecken. Industrial areas in western Germany have been bombed. The Royal Air Force have carried out successful reconnaissance raids over German territory, and by mid-week had released 12,000,000 copies of a message to the German people. On none of these raids were the planes engaged by the enemy.

A daring daylight raid was made on the western mouth of the Kiel Canal on Monday, and heavy damage inflicted on two German battleships, though unfortunately with some loss to the attackers. ■
