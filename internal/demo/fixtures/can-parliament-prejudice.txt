In a Commons debate about air safety, Mr Strachey attacked a private air‑charter company and cited a letter from a former customer. The company has since issued a writ for defamation, and when Mr Strachey tried to raise the matter again the Speaker ruled it sub judice. That ruling has opened a controversy about how Parliament should handle pending court cases.

To the ordinary man there seem to be two kinds of sub judice cases. Few would excuse an MP wrecking a firm’s prospects by an ill‑based statement under privilege. But it is also troubling if discussion of a general principle can be blocked for a year merely because an interested party issues a libel writ.

The greater danger lies in that second extreme. The British tradition about sub judice is unduly apprehensive; judges and juries are unlikely to be swayed by parliamentary pleading. The sensible course is to allow the Speaker discretion to curb special pleading while letting debates on general principle proceed. ■
