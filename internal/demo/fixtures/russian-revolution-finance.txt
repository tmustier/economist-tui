Out of the welter of cables from Russia certain definite facts emerge. The Tsar has abdicated; the reactionary Government has fallen; the Duma has asserted its power, and has behind it strong support from the Army and Navy. It would be premature to claim that the way is now clear, without further trouble, to the establishment of a progressive and stable Government, based upon the popular will. But early indications point that way, and most important at the moment is the general confidence that the first aim of the new regime will be the more vigorous prosecution of the war.

Particularly welcome at this critical juncture are the favourable factors in the financial situation—at least, as regards growth of revenue—which are disclosed by the explanatory memorandum of M. Bark, the Minister of Finance, on the proposed Budget for 1917. As might be expected, this document is somewhat reticent on the subject of war expenditure. A certain degree of secrecy is observed on this point in all belligerent countries; every Treasury keeps salient facts to itself; and if the Russian Treasury is more reticent than others, that is no matter for surprise.

From the figures given in various parts of a somewhat discursive Memorandum it is, however, possible to get an idea of the cost of the war to Russia up to date. In his concluding remarks, M. Bark says that the total “extraordinary war expenditure” up to August 1, 1916, was £1,772,740,000. Elsewhere in the Memorandum we are told that war expenditure in the calendar year 1916 is estimated to have reached £1,287,000,000. A year ago M. Firsoff, as the Reporter on the Budget, made a statement that from August 1, 1914, to January 1, 1916, Russia had spent £1,058,800,000 on exclusive war purposes. ■
