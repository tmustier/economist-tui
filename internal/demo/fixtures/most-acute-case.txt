A report has just come out of Scotland which deserves to be called, without hyperbole, the most raptly interesting economic document to appear from there since the days of Adam Smith. When the committee was set up most people supposed that its main job would be to inquire why Scotland’s average unemployment rate has remained consistently higher than the rest of Britain’s. But the committee has said that unemployment is not Scotland’s real problem.

The really worrying question is why industrial production in Scotland increased by only 13 per cent between 1953 and 1960, compared with the rest of Britain’s 30 per cent and western Europe’s 70 to 80 per cent. The report’s answer, propounded with a mixture of dynamism and mature wisdom, is that “Scotland is suffering in an acute form from the ills to which the whole United Kingdom is subject.”

The main trouble, says the committee, is that Scotland entered the present industrial revolution with its resources heavily engaged in industries that were fated not to be growth industries. The economy has always rested heavily on the “small quantity specialised article,” on building ships or bridges for individual customers and producing craftsmen’s goods. In these industries the structure and tempo of organisation are different from those in the big standardised growth industries of today. ■
