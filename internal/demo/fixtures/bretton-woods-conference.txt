The international monetary conference at Bretton Woods is due to be formally opened on July 1st. Many of the delegations are led by the Finance Ministers of the countries represented. The United States has assembled a formidable team headed by Mr Morgenthau. Judged by the official ranking of its personnel the British delegation is, perhaps, the humblest in the list.

The conference opens with none too good a send-off from the nations represented. The echoes of the grudging acceptance of the monetary fund scheme in recent Parliamentary debates have no doubt followed the British delegation across the Atlantic. An interesting counterpoise to the prevalent criticism of the scheme in Britain is provided by some comment on the monetary fund in the current Survey of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York.

“The problem in world currency stabilisation is not to hold exchange rates in line by direct control, but to remove the causes of instability. This can be done only by inducing the individual nations—and particularly the leading commercial nations—to balance their budgets, promote stability and prosperity of their internal economies and avoid such harmful devices as competitive currency depreciation, prohibitive tariffs and trade and exchange restrictions.”

The Guaranty Survey therefore regards the revised monetary plan as an ineffective instrument for promoting currency stability, a case of mistaken emphasis: an attempt to treat the symptoms, not the disease. ■
