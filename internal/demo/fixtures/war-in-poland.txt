In the last issue of The Economist we were able to carry the chronicle of great events up to the German 16-point “offer” broadcast to the world on Thursday night. It was suggested at the time that the “offer” was a piece of propaganda, since it had only been communicated to Poland two hours before it was declared by Berlin to have been rejected. What could not be known when this comment was penned in the small hours of Friday morning was that even the British Government itself had had no knowledge of the “terms” save such as could be gathered by the Ambassador from a gabbled recital in German by the excited Ribbentrop. Nor was there then any possibility of knowing that Hitler had given his army and his air force orders to attack Poland at dawn, without further excuse or formal declaration of war.

For the first time in his career, we may feel grateful to Hitler. Since a war was quite inevitable (and knowing what we now do of his state of mind, we can clearly see that it was), we could hardly have hoped for a straighter moral issue on which to fight it. The major principles involved have, of course, been established for some time; they are wrapped up in the old antagonism to the doctrine that Might is Right. But the precise occasion of the outbreak might have been confusing; Hitler obliged by making it clear. The famous “offer” was so obviously a piece of clumsy propaganda that nobody outside the borders of Germany (and few, we may suspect, inside) was taken in for more than an hour or two. The Poles were not challenged to fire the first shot by a German coup d’état in Danzig, for though there was such a coup, it came after the Germans had invaded Poland itself. ■
