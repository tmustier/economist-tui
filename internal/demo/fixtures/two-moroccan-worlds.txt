Americans, as they consider what they are giving up in Morocco and what it is costing them to give it up gracefully, may be forgiven a touch of impatience at the sight of France sitting tight at Bizerta, cost what it may in political goodwill or diplomatic convenience. Neither for its position on the Strait of Gibraltar, nor for its long Atlantic coastline opposite their own, could the Americans contemplate a Morocco in hostile hands.

Their air bases in Morocco, built in the early nineteen-fifties under agreements with the French, were designed not to hold the country but to make strategic use of it. Since then Morocco has become independent, and the United States has made alternative air and naval arrangements in Spain. Still, the installations remain a valuable part of the American strategic chain, and the United States Navy and Air Force would have liked to hold on to them. But Moroccan feelings hardened against it, and the Americans decided that the political drawbacks outweighed the military advantages.

President Eisenhower, when he visited the late King in December 1959, agreed that all the American installations should be evacuated by the end of 1963, and the withdrawal is now going on by stages. Both sides are clear that the loss of the bases will not let the Americans treat Morocco with indifference. When the Moroccans faced an agricultural crisis this spring, it was to the Americans that they turned, and the United States responded with wheat and animal feeding stuffs worth $23 million. ■
