“Last night,” wrote Karl Marx in 1853, reporting from London for the New York Tribune, “the debate on India was continued in the House of Commons in the usual dull manner.” In 1947 the India Independence Bill has been passed almost without debate, dull or otherwise. The Government introduced it as urgent and the Opposition, consoled by the provision for Dominion status, refrained from lamentations and prophecies of woe. Nobody could deny that what was now being done was what British statesmen of all parties had declared to be the goal of policy for a generation. It was a foregone conclusion. That we have reached this point in such tranquillity is a matter for congratulation to Mr Attlee and Lord Mountbatten on their statesmanship during the last few months.

Yet it is a time for stocktaking if British opinion is to be prepared for the new era of British‑Indian (or rather British‑Indian‑Pakistani) relations which will open on August 15th. What is now formally about to pass away has been a structure so solid in the memory of men now living that it has appeared to be an institution of remote antiquity. But the British supremacy in India is less than 150 years old; it has been but a brief episode in a history which archaeology has now taken back to the great brick‑built cities of Sind in the third millennium B.C.

But there remained always an underground of memories and sentiments which the new rulers could ignore, but not dispel. Out of the shadows has emerged Pakistan. The name “Pakistan,” an artificial verbal compound said to have been invented by a Moslem Indian student in Cambridge, is unknown to Indian history and was not current in Indian politics until a few years ago. It is not a name which in itself can stir patriotic emotions or evoke mental images of past glory and greatness. ■
