Hurricane Carla had two distinctions as she swirled up from the Caribbean: she was a monster—her “eye” was 50 miles across and her total diameter 350 miles—and like all monsters she moved slowly, at only about 10 miles an hour, although the wind at her centre reached 173 miles an hour. She was the most looked-at woman there has ever been, with naval airmen flying around her and the Tiros weather satellite keeping a television eye on her from space. All this enabled the Weather Bureau to give very efficient warnings of her advance.

As she moved across the Gulf of Mexico onto the low-lying coasts of Texas and Louisiana, 28 towns and cities, including Galveston, Freeport and Texas City, were evacuated successfully; 500,000 people, America’s largest mass migration to date, moved out. They were wise to do so for, if their homes and businesses were not destroyed by either Carla or her attendant tidal waves and tornadoes, they were badly flooded. As she proceeded inland she deteriorated into drenching rains which did serious damage in Oklahoma, Kansas and as far north as Michigan.

Thanks to the advance warning only forty lives were lost, but the financial damage was valued at perhaps $500 million with crop losses in Texas alone amounting to $140 million. Advance warnings did little, however, to reduce the financial damage, and much of Carla’s devastation came from her trail of floods which cannot usually be provided against financially. ■
