The Treaty signed at Versailles last Saturday is only the first of the peace settlements. The decisions of the others are still largely undetermined, and collectively they will redraw the map of Europe; the future of Russia remains uncertain, and with it the eastern boundaries of Poland, the new Baltic States, and Roumania.

Even the provisions of this Treaty with Germany, now signed and awaiting ratification, are by no means final. The reparation clauses may be modified later; the readjustments of territorial boundaries are for the most part subject to plebiscites of the transferred populations, and only in Poland and Alsace-Lorraine are they large enough to make any great difference in area or power.

The transfer of certain small districts with non-German populations to Belgium and Denmark, and the much greater transfers from Germany to Poland, are more than counterbalanced by the coming inclusions of Bohemians in Czechoslovakia and Italians and Bulgars in Yugoslavia and Italy. There is no reason to suppose that such populations will be less restive under alien domination. ■
