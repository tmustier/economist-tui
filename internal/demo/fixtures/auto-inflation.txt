At last the United Automobile Workers and the General Motors Corporation have reached agreement on the non-economic issues—relief periods, production standards, compulsory overtime—which had been holding up a settlement. Any local branch of the union which does not get its men back to work at once will be censured by the national leaders. Only about 25 factories were still closed when the final contract was signed, and the production lines should be working almost full out by early next week.

Other companies hope to reach similar agreements without any stoppages. So the new 1962 cars can be unveiled with certainty that they will in fact be available for customers who are expected to pour into the showrooms and boost this year’s poor sales to record levels for the last quarter. They will find plenty to choose from, 400 or more different models; this year’s novelty is the medium-sized car, an inflated version of the compact which was last year’s favourite.

The automobile workers contend that General Motors can easily pay the costs of the new contract out of profits without putting up prices. While this may be true for the motor industry, it does not necessarily mean that the settlement is non-inflationary. It will set a pattern which other unions will try to match, and in other industries with lower productivity it may not be possible to absorb the additional cost at current prices. ■
