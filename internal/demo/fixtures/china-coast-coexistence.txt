Macao, placid survival of Portuguese colonialism on the south China coast, bore up bravely under the shock of Mr Nehru’s exhausted patience in distant Goa. No one in the tiny colony’s tough-minded Establishment gave a moment’s serious thought to the possibility that Indian anti-colonial aggression might infect Communist China.

There was genuine regret in the gendarmes’ eyes when, under orders from Lisbon, they knocked gently on tidy Macao homes to pick up and intern fifty-odd respected Indian residents. The unpleasant duty was performed with urbanity on both sides; the internees were comfortably housed in a Catholic summer sanctuary under orders for the utmost latitude.

Peking could take Macao by merely turning off the water supply, but the existing set-up clearly suits the Chinese. Foreign exchange flows in through Macao banks, businessmen negotiate trade there, and faithful intermediaries ensure pliable obedience to party orders. The enclave survives because, for now, coexistence is more useful than conquest. ■
