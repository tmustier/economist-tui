The international monetary conference at Bretton Woods is due to be formally opened on July 1st. Many delegations are led by finance ministers; the United States has assembled a formidable team headed by Mr Morgenthau. Judged by official ranking, the British delegation is perhaps the humblest in the list, yet some American newspaper comment has already assumed that the British representatives will get the better of their American guests. The conference opens with none too good a send‑off, the echoes of grudging acceptance of the monetary fund scheme in recent Parliamentary debates having followed the British delegation across the Atlantic.

An interesting counterpoise to criticism in Britain is provided by the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. It argues that the problem in world currency stabilisation is not to keep rates in line by direct control but to remove the causes of instability—balanced budgets, internal stability, and avoidance of competitive depreciation and trade restrictions. The Survey therefore calls the plan “a case of mistaken emphasis,” an attempt to treat symptoms rather than disease, and urges a return of principal nations to the gold standard as promptly as possible after the war. ■
