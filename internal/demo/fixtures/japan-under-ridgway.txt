Japan is entering a new period of its national history. The dismissal of General MacArthur, for nearly six years the supreme symbol of the Occupation as well as a virtual dictator, has probably not preceded the signature of a Japanese peace treaty by more than a matter of weeks. This means that Japan is now emerging from the first political stage after the war and will soon be on its own. What sort of a country will it be? How will it pay its way? These are political and economic questions of very great importance to the rest of the world as well as to the people of Japan, and it is likely that their pattern for many years to come may be determined by what happens during the next twelve to eighteen critically formative months.

General Ridgway, the new Supreme Commander, has already had to do more travelling than his predecessor did in five years. He has also changed the atmosphere in Tokyo from one of aloof infallibility— which had its own merits—to one of contact and friendly discussion both among the members of the Occupation authorities themselves and between them and the Japanese. At a time when, as in Germany, the lid is taken off the occupation, this is an essential development, for in neither Germany nor Japan is it now feasible for the victors of the second world war simply to give orders.

The Occupation authorities have taken three principal measures to plant democracy in Japanese soil. The first was the adoption of the new constitution three years ago this month; this abolished the old prerogatives of the emperor and the restrictions on parliamentary power laid down by the Constitution of 1889. Secondly, a law for agrarian reform was breaking up large landed properties and giving plots of land to some millions of former tenants. Thirdly, there is the legislation which has enabled industrial workers to organise trade unions for the first time. ■
