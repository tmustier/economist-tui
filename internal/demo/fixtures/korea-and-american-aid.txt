The leaders of the free world have shown that they have the will to resist aggression, that they are ready to run risks now to stop militant Communism from picking off its victims one by one. It has been a heartening spectacle. After a pause for thought, American opinion rallied behind the President and his reply to the Security Council appeal for action. A House of Commons that had been deep in a party debate only a few hours earlier closed its ranks behind Mr Attlee when he announced, without qualification, British support for the American decision.

In Europe, opinion—save among the Communists—has proved remarkably steady, obviously relieved that a great moral and political decision should have been taken so quickly. For thirty-six hours one could wonder whether the free nations would rise to the occasion. Would it be said that neither the United States nor any other western government was bound by treaty to defend the Korean Republic? Would it be argued that this was not the issue on which the Communist bluff should be called? Would the voice of neutrality be heard from western Europe, claiming that what happens in the Pacific is a matter for the Americans and the Russians alone?

The possibility that these things might happen must have crossed Mr Acheson’s mind. It was doubtless the Communist calculation and hope that they would. They must have reckoned that a Blitzkrieg would overrun South Korea before the west could screw up its courage to the sticking point. It is very greatly to the credit of President Truman—and, it appears, of General MacArthur—that they were proved wrong. For the reasons that might have been found for doing nothing in Korea would have cast their shadows into the future. ■
