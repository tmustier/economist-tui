Mr Foster, head of the Marshall Plan organisation in the United States, has been telling Europeans much the same optimistic story that the American public has lately been hearing from the men who run its mobilisation effort. What Mr Foster said to Europe this week was, in effect, “You can carry a heavy defence burden and at the same time maintain or even raise your standards of living. Europe can have guns and more butter.”

Theoretically the six-point programme which Mr Foster advanced would do much to achieve this goal. Western Europe, he suggested, should create a mass market and adopt mass production techniques. Restrictive practices should be eliminated. With the savings thus made, European industry could afford both to reduce the price of goods to the consumer and to raise wages. Managers and workers should be trained in methods which will bring greater efficiency and the programme of American technical assistance must be expanded.

If Western Europe is not again bombarded, overrun and exploited by alien forces, Mr Foster may well prove right and European industry may emerge in many ways strengthened by rearmament—just as American productive capacity was greatly expanded by the vast effort of the last war. There is, however, one important proviso which is missing from Mr Foster’s statement. The shortage and the rising prices of raw materials threaten not only rearmament programmes but also the living standards of the ordinary consumer. Until some equitable plan is devised for sharing raw materials and until concerted action is taken to expand their supply to all members of the non-Communist world, talk of higher living standards will only raise false hopes. ■
