Apart from cost reductions, it is reasonable to expect progressive improvements in the quality of synthetic rubbers. These will affect the relative demand for natural and synthetic rubber as much as price changes. At a given price, natural rubber is still generally preferred, for example because processing costs are higher with synthetic than with natural rubber. On the other hand, synthetic rubber is stated to be superior to plantation rubber in resistance to petrol, oil and chemicals.

Predictions are always hazardous, especially about the relative cost and quality of natural and synthetic rubber. To say that natural rubber is no dying industry is a reasonably safe guess. Its position is not analogous to that of Chile nitrate after the last war. For general purposes natural rubber will continue to be demanded in large quantities if it is made available at low prices, but synthetic rubber would become a formidable competitor to an inefficient natural rubber industry.

Apart from the physical interchangeability of crude and synthetic rubber for many general purposes, there is a growing field for synthetic rubber for special purposes. There is room for both. ■
