Last week the Commons debated a Labour backbencher’s motion noting the growing power of the advertising industry and calling for an independent inquiry. Parts of the motion were odd, since three official inquiries are already under way: the Molony committee on consumer protection, the Pilkington committee on television, and the royal commission on the press.

The £453 million spent on advertising in 1960 represented 2.2 per cent of national income, only a modest increase on 1938 and arguably too small for a competitive economy. Those who fear big advertisers leaning on newspapers are mistaken: restricting advertising would not remove the threat, it could increase it by shrinking the market and encouraging inducements.

The real democratic principle is that nobody should be misled. The proper remedy is to enforce honest standards, not to treat advertising as a menace in itself. ■
