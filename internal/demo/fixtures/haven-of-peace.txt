Politics in east and central Africa will be changed by the emergence, on December 9th, of an independent Tanganyika. For a while Dar-es-Salaam will become the natural capital of African nationalist activity in the surrounding territories; not until October 1962 will Uganda, the next in line for independence, be able to claim the same amount of pan-Africanist attention. On Monday the importance of Dar-es-Salaam was underlined when several African nationalist leaders ended their meeting in the town by signing a joint statement of aims.

The signatories were Mr Nyerere, the Tanganyikan prime minister; Mr Kenyatta, Mr Nkomo, Mr Kaunda and Dr Banda of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland; and a representative from Zanzibar. These men held their first board meeting. They welcomed Uganda’s coming independence, pledged to fight for popular government elsewhere, and were determined to make all other African lands independent and united.

The importance of their statement is that it effectively gives notice of what is to come in east and central Africa. The centre of activity for the men who will press these claims will almost certainly be the Haven of Peace—or, in its African name, Dar-es-Salaam. ■
