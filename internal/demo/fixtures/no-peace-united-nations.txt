Whenever Mr Kennedy and Mr Macmillan meet, they cannot avoid the sharp cross‑fire in which the United Nations is caught. In the United States as in Britain, the organisation is under fire from right‑wing conservatives over its operations in Katanga, while its warmest supporters have been chilled by India’s ability to swallow Goa without a Security Council rebuke.

Unless the agreement just reached in the Congo is converted into a stable settlement, the Administration will face trouble in Congress over its support for the UN in Katanga. Senator Dodd is pressing for an investigation, Senator Lausche calls the UN action illegal, and public opinion is being whipped up by a committee styling Katanga the Hungary of 1961. The extremists ignore that chaos in the Congo invites communist penetration.

A number of true friends of the UN are disturbed by the need to make war to preserve peace, but in the long run the greater damage may come over Goa. With the Afro‑Asian members unwilling to back a cease‑fire, the UN’s ability to keep the peace is being tested on multiple fronts. ■
