As we write, one of the world’s historic dramas is unfolding before our eyes. For the second time the British Prime Minister is in conference with Herr Hitler, while, on the other side of Germany, elemental forces have been released which may disintegrate the State of Czechoslovakia unless a halt is promptly called from Godesberg, Warsaw and Budapest by those who have the power to control the storm. Mr Chamberlain’s first task is to ensure that this call is given; for otherwise the fate of Central Europe will have passed beyond the pale of sober discussion or considerations of justice and right.

Seven days ago we were compelled by the time-table to write at the moment of the Prime Minister’s first flight to Germany. Out of the despair of the preceding days, when it seemed as if nothing could hold the world back from the madness of universal war, Mr Chamberlain’s flight seemed to offer fresh hope. To the peoples of every country in the world—not least to the patient German people—his descent on Berchtesgaden from the clouds relaxed the unbearable tension. What has happened in one week has so far avoided a new Armageddon; but it has left the outlook for European security and European liberties greatly darkened.

From Sunday onwards the disillusionment has been swift and universal, for, in one of the great political tragedies of the world, Czechoslovakia has been compelled to accept dismemberment without any assurances of security from Germany beyond those which Mr Chamberlain may be able to secure for her in his present talks. ■
