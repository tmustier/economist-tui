The Adoula–Tshombe meeting at Kitona is an achievement for the United Nations, which has fought hard for it during 1961. Tshombe’s boycott of the Lovanium conference left him isolated as the lone secessionist, and the meeting offers a chance for some kind of agreement.

Even if a deal emerges, the Congo’s finances remain grim. The loss of Katanga cost Leopoldville half the country’s exports; the deficit is estimated at nine billion Congolese francs, and the only ways to bridge it are foreign subventions or inflationary central‑bank advances. Army pay swallows nearly all domestic revenue, and the central government is more façade than authority.

Without substantial foreign aid—around $300 million over two years—and a united European policy, the outlook is bleak. The return of Belgian personnel would help, but security fears remain. The Congo needs stability and resources more than it needs another conference. ■
