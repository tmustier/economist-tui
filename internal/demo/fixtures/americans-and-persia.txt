Mr Morrison and senior Foreign Office officials have spent two days in intensive but inconclusive discussion on petroleum problems with Mr McGhee, the Assistant Secretary of State, who has just returned from Persia and the Middle East. The Foreign Office was anxious to learn the latest American views on the strategic dangers which may arise from neglecting British interests. These conferences form an important prelude to petroleum talks which are to take place next week in Washington.

A delegation of officials and oil experts has already left London, briefed to discuss Anglo-American policy in the Middle East in the hope of reaching an unofficial agreement on the general lines of action to be taken in Persia. The delegation will consider with Mr McGhee the economic consequences of any new deal likely to be negotiated between Teheran and London. No attempt is being made, on either side of the Atlantic, to minimise the gravity or urgency of the situation. But full measures to maintain the stability of the area have yet to be finally decided. Meanwhile, the Persians have privately invited American experts and technicians to advise and assist in the process of “nationalisation”—a move which is, to say the least, premature. ■
