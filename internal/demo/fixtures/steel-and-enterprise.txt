Even after the prospective increase—still further delayed this week—of £4-£5 a ton, the home price of British steel will remain among the cheapest in the world. This favourable comparison has been a legitimate source of pride to the industry ever since the war and has offered a stock answer to any questioning of its price policy. But it may be beside the point in calmer enquiries. Steel can be too cheap. The present excess of indiscriminate demand that has made necessary a cumbersome allocation system and the import of much foreign steel at up to twice the British home price would indeed suggest that it is too cheap now. Although the profits of most steel companies have risen since 1948, in real terms the heavy section of the steel industry may still be giving its capital away.

Steel prices, it should be said at the outset, are still under Government control. The experience gained has been cumulative, and the methods now used display some sophistication in avoiding the technical weaknesses to which some official price controls are prone. Periodic statistics of the production costs of steel are supplied to the Ministry, and prices are fixed on the basis of average costs for each product, with a standard margin for fixed charges and profit. The question of how price is related to costs therefore remains central to the public interest, doubly so when the return of the core of the industry from public to private ownership is to be undertaken. ■
