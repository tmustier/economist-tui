This week President Kennedy stepped up the American export drive. Firms that have contributed significantly to expanded exports will be entitled to fly a flag with a blue E on a white field, the old war‑production emblem for Excellence. Firms awarded an E will be permitted to advertise the fact and to give their workers E pins to wear. An increase in exports, the President says, is “the next great frontier we must cross.”

In his speech to the National Association of Manufacturers he argued that America’s favourable trade balance must be enlarged to help finance responsibilities abroad—troops and bases—so trade remains an instrument of foreign policy. He wants to replace the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act with a stronger instrument to prise open the vast new market across the Atlantic, a market that, if Britain joins it, will have more people than either the United States or Russia.

America views the European Economic Community with mingled pride and apprehension. Many rejoice in Europe’s new unity as a counterweight to Russia, but there are warnings that a trade war may divide the West and fears that bargaining for lower tariffs may rob Americans of jobs. ■
