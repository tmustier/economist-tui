Wall Street, pleased with both the higher prices and the increase in trading volume, was impressed with the nature of the advance, as it was led by the standard industrial issues such as Dupont, General Motors, Dow Chemical and Union Carbide. Brokers thought demand would spread from the blue chips to second-rank issues, particularly in industries likely to benefit from higher defence spending and the general business recovery. Thus there was good demand for aircraft, motors, steels and chemicals, while some of the more ostentatious market formers in publishing, electronics and recreation were being snubbed.

Since President Kennedy’s speech on the Berlin crisis, the market can be said to have launched its summer rally, with the Dow Jones average rising by almost five per cent in a week and many individual issues by over ten per cent. Followers of the Dow theory were not entirely convinced, however, because the railroad industry was plagued with drought in the west and a combination of severe competition and financial burdens in the east.

Some institutional investors, which had been adding to their holdings of foreign issues, were now buying American stocks once again. While Washington was not showing any signs of shifting away from its easy money policy, Wall Street was taking a boom for granted and regarded the tightening of the credit brakes as inevitable. In the meantime, equities were in vogue again. ■
