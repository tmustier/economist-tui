By issuing firm instructions on what is and what is not to be done, Aly Maher Pasha, Egypt’s new prime minister, has done his country a great service. Public confidence is returning daily; Cairo shopkeepers are resuming business in their ruined premises; many of those suspected of organising the riots have been arrested, including Ahmed Hussein, the leader of Egypt’s shirt movement when shirts were fashionable and now a master of subversive patter. Road and telephone communications with the canal zone have been partially restored, and Egyptian contractors, and even Egyptian labourers, are inquiring whether their old contracts and jobs are still open there.

These signs draw attention to several important points. The authority of the Crown, which has often been underrated and called unpopular, is still an effective instrument when used as King Farouk used it last week; for example, it commanded the absolute loyalty of the army. The pasha class is still respected and obeyed the moment it acts for the public safety or welfare. The whole of the better-to-do class is, for the moment, showing the prudence which comes of having looked into the abyss of revolution.

Aly Maher has spoken openly of the Middle East Command and the security pact between Arab states as matters for discussion with his new National Front Committee of twelve. But that body includes two of the Wafd’s most intransigent members, bent on fulfilling the “national will,” which is that the British should leave and recognise the Egyptian crown’s title to the Sudan. British statesmen have, therefore, to make up their minds whether it is worth negotiating on a basis of which the difficulties are plain to see, or whether some entirely new approach would not be wiser. The British objective is something more than to make terms with Egypt; it is to organise Middle East defence. ■
