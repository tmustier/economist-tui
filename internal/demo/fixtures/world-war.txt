Even this war of crisis upon crisis must now have reached its ultimate boundaries. The Japanese bombs on Pearl Harbour started a new war and merged two old ones, until now a single vast conflict embraces the whole globe. There is fighting in Europe, Asia and Africa, and there will be fighting tomorrow in America and Australasia. There is a battle of the Atlantic, a battle of the Pacific and a battle of the Mediterranean—and there may well be a battle of the Indian Ocean soon. Save for the surrounded Swiss and Swedes, the obstinate Irish and the peripheral Portuguese, every state on earth is enrolled in one camp or the other; every day the pre-belligerent are taking the plunge, the timid are being constrained and the hesitant nerved.

There is no need to waste words on the foul treachery of the Japanese in launching an attack under a flag of truce. There is no need to recount the details of their assaults on Hawaii, Malaya, Thailand, Hongkong and the Philippines. There is no time to mourn the losses that have already been suffered—the air-raid casualties at Honolulu and Manila, the naval losses at Pearl Harbour (of which little is known except that they are serious) and the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse.

The first bombs to fall on Pearl Harbour proved to every American citizen that it was his own chestnuts that were in question. By choosing an American objective and launching the attack with every circumstance of insolence and treachery, the Japanese have, with forethought and intent, brought into the war against them a nation of 140 millions and the greatest industrial power in the history of mankind. They have performed the miracle of ending all American disputes overnight: the declaration of war was voted with but one dissentient vote in a Congress of 531 members. ■
