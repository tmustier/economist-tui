The communiqué issued after the Cairo conference of Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, King Saud and President Shukry el-Kuwatly was in its generalisations so like many earlier Arab conference declarations that its difference passed unnoticed by many people. It eschewed the vituperative jargon of nationalism in favour of that studied moderation of language which was Nehru's spiritual contribution to Bandoeng. The “interference of great powers” and the possibility of “pressure” replaced the “imperialist aggression” of past pronouncements. East and West were lumped together impartially in a single phrase: “the evils of the cold war.”

This vocabulary was deliberate and it was Colonel Nasser’s. Throughout the conference people close to him were stressing the constructive intention that he had in calling it and his desire to create a policy for the Arabs, not to attack the policies of others. The emphasis was on defence and protection: protection of the Arab world against pressure from the Baghdad Pact countries, protection of the Arab character of Buraimi and Oman, defence against Israeli aggression.

The policy enunciated leaves no room for current British policy in the Arab Middle East. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria have declared that the Arab Nation exists and must be freed from the ties which bind it to great powers. The communiqué tacitly invites the Foreign Office to recognize that a steady withering-away of its formal positions must take place. ■
