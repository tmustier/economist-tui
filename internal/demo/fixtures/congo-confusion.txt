Within the last few days there was the curious sight at Leopoldville airport of plane-loads of Belgians flying into the Congo while others, in a panic, flew out. This oddity typifies the confusion that befogs the country as the Katanga crisis drags on unsettled. The Congo may have been more lethal in the past; rarely has the situation been more irrational. As well as the Leopoldville–Elisabethville vendetta, there is a new secessionist movement in Orientale, a breakdown of law and order in Kasai, a serious split in Equateur, and a wave of Baluba bellicosity in North Katanga.

The ordinary, amiable Congolese continues to display a resilience and a talent for recuperation which are his country’s saving grace, but for western observers the disturbing question is how long the prime minister, Mr Adoula, can retain effectual control if things continue to disintegrate. Too many of his colleagues were appointed on grounds of expediency and are out of their depth. Faced with agitation for strong-arm action to clobber Katanga, Mr Adoula and General Mobutu launched the ill‑starred offensive which soon disintegrated into mutiny and rampage.

The damage has been more psychological than military, but the government has lost confidence and prestige through its association with this fiasco. The military failure has brought disorder in its wake and shown up the apparent incapacity of the central government to control its vast territories. ■
