The figures in the President’s Economic Report to Congress and in his Budget message this week had, as Mr Marquis Childs said, “an Alice-in-Wonderland quality” because what Mr Truman asked for had little or no relation to what Congress might ultimately grant. But there are certain important lessons to be drawn from this review of the past and the estimates of what will happen, regardless of a wayward Congress, in the future. In terms of 1951 prices, the gross national product of the United States, which was about the same in 1939 as it had been in 1929, rose by $90 billion between 1939 and 1947 and has risen by a further $60 billion since then. It is expected to rise another $20 billion by the end of 1952. Up to now, this increase has been more than the total cost of the security programme.

But there remains the problem that it is a country of 150 million people on a planet with more than 2,500 million. And should the overwhelming majority of the other 2,350 million be driven to bitter hostility by American economic policies, all the productivity of North America would count for very little. So the President must make his greatest effort this spring to persuade a reluctant Congress to provide “both military and economic aid to free nations” and must also try again to make them accept the necessity for supporting “the efforts which underdeveloped countries are making to further their own economic development.” ■
