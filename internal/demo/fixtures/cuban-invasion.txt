It is admitted that this was “an American operation,” over which the President had control. The United States provided much of the financial backing, the organisation and the equipment which made possible the launching, from a Nicaraguan island under lease to the United States, in American ships and landing-craft, of some 1,200 anti-Castro Cubans with a few tanks, aircraft and a considerable armament on to a singularly ill-chosen beach-head in Cuba.

Nor is it denied that the Central Intelligence Agency subsidised the exiles in Florida, provided instructors in guerrilla warfare, commandeered disused airfields, set up training camps in Guatemala and caused coastguards to turn blind eyes. The operation began nine months before Mr Kennedy took office, but he did not order it to be discontinued. Even two weeks ago, when the CIA said the invasion was now or never, President Kennedy could still have barred the operation.

He resolved his doubts by proclaiming his decision not to commit any American forces. He seems to have thought that the United States was exonerated for transgressing the neutrality laws by his statement that this was “a struggle between Cubans,” along with a warning to the Cubans that if they lost they would not be bailed out. ■
