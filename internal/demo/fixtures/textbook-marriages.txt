The direct result has been the creation of several new major publishing firms, offering publications ranging from technical reference books down to juveniles for school and public libraries. An example is the purchase within the last eighteen months by Random House of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., Beginner Books, Inc., the L. W. Singer Company, Inc., and Pantheon Books. Another example is Western Publishing, which bought a firm specialising in children’s books last February and a publisher of high school and college texts two months later.

The key to capital by this means was the textbook, a publication prepared and sold as an essential educational instrument. Basic textbooks, those required for compulsory courses, involve considerable investment in their development—$3,000,000 in a recent case—but provide a very substantial return if the book succeeds in capturing a significant portion of the total market.

Projections for the next decade point to increases of 25 per cent in elementary schools, 60 per cent in secondary schools, and a full 100 per cent in colleges and universities. This indicated a promising increase in potential markets for publishers of texts, but not one equal to what in fact happened to publishers’ shares between July 1959 and March 1961. ■
