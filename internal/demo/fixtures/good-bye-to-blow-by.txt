By the end of 1962 a brighter New Year will be in sight, for all new motor cars will be fitted with a device to eliminate much of the blow-by, the fumes of unburned petrol coming from the crankcase. These constitute about 40 per cent of the hydrocarbons emitted by automobiles that pollute the air and help to cause smog. Since the end of 1960 all new cars sold in California have carried the device, which sends blow-by fumes back into the engine to be burned.

Early this month the Automobile Manufacturers’ Association recommended that its members install the device in all new cars and lorries. This is a victory for Mr Ribicoff and other advocates of purer air. Four months ago he warned the producers that he would press for compulsory legislation unless they promised to install blow-by control on all cars and lorries by January 1st, starting with the 1964 models.

Faced with that ultimatum the manufacturers decided to comply a year earlier. The device is likely to add less than $5 to the cost of a car when mass-produced. It will not solve the whole problem—exhaust fumes still remain—but it marks a first, significant step toward cleaner air. ■
