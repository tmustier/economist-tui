One of the many dangers threatening the United Nations at the moment is that it will be disrupted by a struggle over the representation of China. If the Communists are seated this would be a serious defeat for the United States and might dissipate the new determination and purpose which President Kennedy hopes to inspire in the United Nations by his personal appearance before it. It would also alienate many Americans just at the time when American faith in that organisation is essential to its future.

To many Americans with memories of a missionary past and of the Korean war, any dealings with Communist China are a personal affront; an important section of public opinion is reflected in repeated congressional resolutions against recognition of Communist China or its admission to the United Nations. The Administration can hardly afford to be accused of “softness” on Communist China.

Faced with this situation and with the virtual certainty that this year it would no longer be possible to avoid consideration of membership for Communist China in the United Nations, the Administration worked out a new strategy. The western allies will contend that it is a “major question” demanding a two-thirds majority, then propose a special committee to report in 1962, postponing the show-down for another year. ■
