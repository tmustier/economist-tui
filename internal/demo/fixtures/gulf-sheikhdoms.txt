The British silver cord has been loosed; all the Queen’s gunboats and men cannot perfectly restore the peace of mind of the rich Gulf sheikhs round their oil wells, or the poor ones on their barren shores. After generations of basking under British protection, Kuwait’s frightening encounter with freedom has shaken its neighbour sheikhdoms. Though they all have treaties with Britain and can call, like Kuwait, for help, they know that Kuwait’s dilemma is theirs.

Their dilemma, whether rich or poor, is that they are thoroughly dated. And the rich ones are fabulously rich without the responsibilities that great inheritance should normally bring. Tiny principalities playing at independence under the cover of being merely “British protected,” they disturb rational thought by their unabashed feudal systems and general untidiness. It is no sin to be small; but it is dangerous to be so small and so emphatically outmoded.

A million people, divided, and ruled by eleven proud rulers: this is the sum and content of the Persian Gulf principalities. The oil-rich communities, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, have a joint population of less than 400,000. The remaining 100,000 are dispersed among the lean and hungry sheikhdoms, dreaming of oil and scraping their deserts for a living. ■
