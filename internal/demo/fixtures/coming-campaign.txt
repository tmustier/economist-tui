In the United States the period between the two public holidays, Independence Day on July 4th and Labour Day on the first Monday of September, is the official holiday period. During that time shops and offices are shut on Saturday mornings, only urgent work is done and, even in an election year, it is considered a waste of time to make political speeches to a people deep in the pursuit of pleasure. Polling day being the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, this timetable mercifully leaves a bare two months for campaigning—not a long time for a candidate who wants to cover forty-eight States and, perhaps, a hundred cities.

Mr Dewey and Mr Warren, the Republican nominees, have had many meetings and laid their plans with great care. Governor Warren will start from San Francisco on September 15th for a ten-day trip ending in Detroit, with stops in Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. Governor Dewey will leave Albany for the West a few days later. The President will begin his campaign at the earliest possible moment. A joint rally to be held by the American Federation of Labour and the Congress of Industrial Organisations on Labour Day in Detroit gives him an excellent opportunity for an important opening speech, and he will make four others in Michigan on the same day.

The two candidates, it appears, are in no hurry to get at each other’s throats too soon. Mr Truman, as he made clear in his acceptance speech, will fight Congress; Congress will fight the Communists; the Communists, through their control of the Progressive Party, will fight the Dixiecrats; and the Dixiecrats will fight the President. The circle is complete without Mr Dewey, who can sit in the middle picking off his warring opponents one by one. ■
