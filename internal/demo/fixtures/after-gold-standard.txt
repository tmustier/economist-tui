Some surprise has been expressed at the institution and maintenance of a 6 per cent Bank rate. It is argued that with the suspension of the gold standard the normal function of a high Bank rate, namely the attraction and retention of foreign funds, has ceased to operate, and that the only effect of the 6 per cent rate is to penalise unnecessarily home trade and industry. Such a point of view is perfectly legitimate, but it should scarcely have occasioned surprise that the authorities should have felt it desirable in a situation of almost unparalleled uncertainty to take, at least as an initial measure, normal precautionary steps.

It must be remembered that in this, as in previous weeks, the exchange value of the pound is governed mainly by big capital movements. Last week the effect of an outflow of funds was to cause gold shipments, but this week and henceforward capital movements will express themselves in wide variations of the actual rates of exchange, which are no longer held in place by the gold points. Many apparently baffling fluctuations in the exchanges must be expected during the next few weeks, and it is far too early to determine what is the intrinsic value of the pound and at what level in the exchange market it is likely to settle down.

As was to be expected, the Bank return records several wide changes, some of which relate to the period of the heavy drain upon London during the last three days when the gold standard was still in force. There has been an increase of only £1.1 million in the note circulation, a perfectly normal movement which shows that home confidence in the British banking system is unabated. Gold losses amount to £1.9 million, all of which occurred last week; the Reserve consequently is £3.0 million lower, but the proportion still stands at the strong figure of 41½ per cent. ■
