It is not very clear what sort of new machinery for long-term economic planning the Chancellor was trying to adumbrate to trade unionists and employers this week, but there are indications that he may be misconceiving what the aims of planning should be. The objective of planning should not be to get some “representative” committee of trade union leaders, large employers and establishment figures to sit down together, air their mutual prejudices, and strike meaningless verbal compromises with each other, in the hope that Britain’s economic difficulties will then somehow be rubbed away. On the contrary, the purpose of any effective new planning machinery should be to diminish the practical power of some of these organised groups, and to increase the influence over public policy and attitudes of what might be called the economic technocrats.

Everybody who has studied the way in which various nations’ economic policies have been run since the war knows who these economic technocrats are. They are men who think and operate in terms of production targets and planned efficiency drives; they play something of the role in some nations’ affairs that time-and-motion-study men play in some individual factories, and they have some of the disadvantages and drawbacks of those stopwatch men. The planning technocrats can make big mistakes, yet the fact remains that several successful countries in Europe have expanded their economies more quickly because men who try to guide governments’ policies with both eyes on statistical production targets are in positions of public influence. ■
