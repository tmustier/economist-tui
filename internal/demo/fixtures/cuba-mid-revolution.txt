For anyone with decided opinions about Cuba it is a bad mistake actually to go there. The visiting liberal finds himself bouncing between enthusiasm and disapproval, both equally fervent, half a dozen times a day. In a revolution run by Latin American marxists it is remarkably difficult to reach a neat generalisation that Cuba, as a thing, is good or bad. All that can be said is that the evidence that it may turn out bad has been slightly more noticeable in the last few months.

Things look considerably better in the country outside Havana than they look in the capital. The agrarian reform programme, the heart of the original revolution, is, to use the most reticent adjective, a splendid piece of work. This is not to say that it is a stranger to chaos or to mismanagement, but the programme is undoubtedly a success in the improvement of people as well as of statistics. What is most impressive in the countryside is the change made by the revolution in people’s attitude to life.

When the visitor turns back to Havana, however, he detects a different spirit. In place of the bearded, warm-eyed figures running the agrarian reform in the countryside there is a larger proportion of an altogether less attractive brand of revolutionary. The bureaucracy is getting clogged, and there are the first indistinct signs of repression. ■
