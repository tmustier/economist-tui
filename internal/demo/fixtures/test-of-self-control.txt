Keep cool, don’t be flustered into doing things you may regret: this is what the West has been telling itself since Mr Khrushchev banged his nuclear fist on the table a week ago. In giving itself this sensible advice, the West has been thinking chiefly of Berlin. But the advice applies equally well to another problem: what policy ought the allies to adopt towards nuclear weapons, now that the tests suspended in 1958 have begun again? It is tempting to conclude that Mr Khrushchev’s return to the ritual of explosions, followed by President Kennedy’s decision to resume American tests, marks the death of the attempt to keep nuclear weapons under control. Yet it is a mark of being flustered to say that there is now no alternative to an unrestrained race for nuclear superiority.

Two questions have to be decided. The first is whether Mr Kennedy, having ordered the resumption of tests “which prudent men find essential,” is now willing to limit these tests to the briefest series compatible with military necessity. By making known so soon his decision to go ahead, the President has lost some of the international sympathy that came America’s way last week. Since he has not waited longer, the forthcoming series of American tests can, and should, be kept as short as possible. ■
