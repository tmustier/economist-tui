Mr Tshombe’s failure to hand over his Irish prisoners in the exchange that was to have sealed a cease-fire was, unhappily, predictable. The Katanga president’s trail of broken promises is now so long that the only question left is whether he is personally responsible for all his irresponsibilities, or is not a free agent. For more than a year he has veered between declarations of independence and pledges of loyalty to a united Congo; between undertakings to halt bloodshed in his province and arbitrary cancellation of them; between signed agreements to co-operate with the United Nations and rabble-rousing calls for action against the UN.

On August 28th he publicly announced that all Europeans had been removed from his gendarmerie. It was in response to assurances then given by him and by the local Belgian consul that the UN halted its round-up of mercenaries in Katanga, only to find when the round-up was resumed on September 13th that these Europeans were now prepared not only to start a battle but even to continue it despite a cease-fire appeal from Mr Tshombe.

Dr Sture Linner’s report made clear that the first shots came from a building occupied by European officers. If Lord Lansdowne wants to clear up a mystery, he might ask how Mr Tshombe got the Irishmen whom he is now using as bargaining counters. ■
