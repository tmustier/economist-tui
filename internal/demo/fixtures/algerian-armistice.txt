The Algerian rebels are going to talk in Paris: now the difficult part begins. The danger, even the probability, of failure has been reiterated on all sides this week. This caution is perfectly explicable, and it does no harm after the wordy optimism that has blown about Paris for five unregenerate years. Yet what may be needed more, if the difficulties of the coming weeks are to be surmounted, is the certain and abiding conviction within France of all that a Franco-Algerian settlement can do and bring about in Africa and in the Middle East.

The great change that has taken place in Algeria is that General de Gaulle has committed himself to negotiations with the rebels. He has to press ahead now; if the talks break down he will be the loser and the diehards the only gainers. Officially, the Elysée maintains that there are just three topics to be discussed: a ceasefire, the disposition of weapons, and the future of the rebel combatants. These were the terms of General de Gaulle’s offer on June 14th. The immediate question to be decided is whether the rebels are prepared to start within this formula.

Publicly, they are not. M. Ferhat Abbas’s reply was in the name of the provisional government of the Algerian republic, and it declared that the French position was still distant from its own. The talks could thus founder if the rebel delegation insists on political preconditions that General de Gaulle is unwilling, or unable, to concede. Yet the studied moderation of language in the general’s new offer suggests a tacit understanding that it is now the talks, not the preconditions, that matter. ■
