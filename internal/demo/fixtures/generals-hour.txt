General de Gaulle is now the French Republic. Whether or not he wishes to be a dictator, he is now the dictator of France. He holds the republic’s powers; its responsibilities rest on him. Its very existence is in his hands, to do with as he chooses, or as best he can. This much stands clear today; nothing else does, except the ineluctable problems, the legacy of the republic and of its crisis, that confront him and to which not even he can offer an easy solution. For France, in fact, only one decision has been taken, and one danger averted, by the transfer of authority to the general: the decision not to risk a military coup in Paris itself and the civil disorder which would have followed it.

The big questions before the general are Algeria and finance, and the two interlock. Is he, in political fact, the arbiter and conciliator he sought to be? Can he make his arbitrament in Algeria independently of the assurances given to the settlers there in three weeks of emotional oratory? Will the army give its first allegiance to the general or to the committee of public safety in Algiers? And can the general implement a national economic policy in France itself independent of the interests which backed his return to power?

General de Gaulle did not make any valid assertions on the future of Algeria on his first triumphal day there. The power of government in Algiers is among the powers he has personally assumed; if it remains a fact after the enthusiasm generated by his arrival dies down, he will be able to tackle all of France’s problems in the Maghreb. He has already added a fresh note to French policy in North Africa by his civil exchange of greetings with President Bourguiba and the King of Morocco. ■
