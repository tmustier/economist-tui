Between them the Civil Aeronautics Board and three transcontinental airlines managed to give many travellers a miserable Christmas. People who bought tickets at the experimental cheap excursion rate introduced in August found—often only at the airport—that the CAB had refused to extend the concession past December 15th. Such a muddle is not likely to be repeated, but the signs are that most domestic airlines have abandoned hopes of solving their problems by making flying cheaper; they are instead filing requests for higher coach fares.

Their justification is the $30 million that the Air Transport Association estimates was lost by the eleven trunk lines in 1961, the largest collective loss in their history. Passenger traffic has risen hardly at all this year, while costs have leapt under the weight of jet purchases, interest charges and depreciation. Air traffic improved in November and early December, suggesting temporary troubles may pass.

For the deeper problems of over-capacity and excessive competition, mergers are the cure prescribed by the CAB. National Airlines and Continental Air Lines have agreed to join forces, and the announcement has set off new hints of consolidation among bigger carriers. In the long run, some such reshaping may be required before air travel can promise lower prices again. ■
