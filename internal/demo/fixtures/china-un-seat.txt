Only 36 of the UN Assembly’s 104 members voted on December 15th in favour of transferring the Chinese seat to Peking, a result that surprised even Washington. Of the 49 Asian and African members, only 20 backed Peking along with the Soviet bloc and a handful of Europeans; sixteen Afro‑Asian states voted against and thirteen abstained.

The procedural tussle was illuminating. Apart from the Soviet group, only eleven states fought all the way for a simple-majority transfer; once that failed, others could manoeuvre in what had become dead ground. Britain voted for Peking in the final ballot while saying it did not want the Nationalists expelled, a posture shared by several who voted against Peking.

An amendment to drop the demand to expel the Nationalists and simply seat Peking drew 30 votes from Britain, the Scandinavians, Israel and two dozen Afro‑Asians. Though defeated, it hinted at the shape of future debates and showed how far the tide has yet to turn. ■
