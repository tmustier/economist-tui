One of America’s wry nightclub comedians was wondering this week if the machines that won wars would have enough sense to leave some people alive. Another speculated that, at the rate things are going, by next Christmas a whole new economic class may arise—the nouveau poor.

These are the jokes of the affluent, offered over untouched slabs of butter and weight‑reducing menus, yet they point to a real unease about the nuclear age and the costs of abundance. Even in the richest society, the fear is that technological triumph might outrun human survival.

The humour is brittle, but it betrays a serious anxiety: affluence without security is a thin comfort, and a world armed with machines capable of total destruction must learn restraint before it learns another punchline. ■
