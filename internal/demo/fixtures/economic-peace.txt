In the speech delivered to a joint session of Congress, President Wilson made it clear that the first thing to be done is to win the war, and that victory means Germany agreeing through accredited representatives to a settlement and reparation of wrongs. With equal clearness he made it evident to the German people that the hazy threats uttered by some European leaders are not endorsed by the great Western republic.

Germans have been told they are fighting for the very life of their empire. Wilson answered that “no one is threatening the existence or the independence or the peaceful enterprise of the German Empire.” City opinion agrees with the sentiment that, except as a legitimate war measure, there is no desire to deny Germany her place among the great commercial communities of the world.

Well‑informed opinion in the City is strong that an economic boycott of Germany in time of peace would be difficult to impose, undesirable if it were possible, and that threats of such a policy only stimulate German war enthusiasm. Like President Wilson, the City is convinced that the first business is to win the war; it does not believe that the war should be won by declaring that, even when it is over, everything will be done to keep Germany out of the world’s markets. ■
