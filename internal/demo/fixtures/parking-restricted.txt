It may be ungracious to suggest a connection between President Kennedy’s reception in Washington of General Park, South Korea’s military ruler, and the release from house arrest four days earlier of Dr Chang, the former prime minister; but it is probably accurate. The statement issued after their meeting, non-committal for the most part, nevertheless expressed Mr Kennedy’s “gratification” at the progress made by the military government, and promised “all possible economic aid” for its projected five-year plan.

To win this degree of approval from the President, who declined to receive the original leader of the military junta when it seized power last May, General Park presumably had to provide some evidence of a softening in his rigorous rule. He had already promised to hold an election in May 1963 to elect a civilian government. The release of Dr Chang, arrested on the unlikely charge of having connived at communist activity during his year in office, is accompanied by the freeing of seven former ministers and a number of allegedly pro-communist students.

General Park continues to use stringent measures against South Korea’s widespread corruption, and against those who propose contacts with communist North Korea as a step towards reunification. To be impartially stern is at least a sign of growing sophistication. ■
