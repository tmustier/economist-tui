GENERAL FULGENCIO BATISTA, the long-established dictator of Cuba, has finally been given the push. Although his country has been in a state of suppressed civil war for two years, he has always insisted that, except for a tiresome band of maquisards in the eastern extremity of the island, everything was under control. Now that the revolutionaries under Señor Fidel Castro have begun to look like turning their tenacity into victory and have advanced from the swamps of Sierra Maestra to Santa Clara in central Cuba, the regular army has stepped in to end the war in its own way.

General Batista’s downfall means one military dictator the less; the Afro-Asian trend is in reverse in Latin America. But it is not at all clear what sort of regime will follow. The three-man military junta that has taken over has followed constitutional practice by appointing Señor Carlos Piedra, the oldest member of the Supreme Court, as provisional president. If the army follows the precedent of Venezuela, it will hold the reins only until a new president can be honestly elected. But it is still obscure whether it intends to go on fighting the rebels, or to try to negotiate.

Fidel Castro, whose own political evolution has followed a zig-zag path, has apparently refused to recognise the junta’s authority and has put forward a provisional president of his own, Dr Manuel Urrutia, a lawyer. But the rebel camp has been swollen this winter by many liberals who, while they may not much approve of their opportunist leader, like dictatorship even less. Now that the Batista regime has cracked, these men may urge Señor Castro to come to terms so that Cuba can make a fresh start with a degree of unity. ■
