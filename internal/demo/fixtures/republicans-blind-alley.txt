It is not healthy for a country with a two-party system to undergo twenty years of uninterrupted rule by one of them. The party in power becomes debilitated and that in opposition exasperated. In the United States, where spoils are an important adjunct of office, the dangers of such a situation are multiplied. The opposition, in its frustration, adopts increasingly dubious tactics and the Administration, clinging for dear life to office—and the patronage which goes with it—becomes too timorous to meet the issues squarely.

A month ago, with the elections only eighteen months away, the Democratic Party seemed to be disintegrating fast. The revelations of organised crime in the big cities and petty corruption reaching into the White House had reduced public confidence in Mr Truman and the men around him to the lowest point it had ever reached. With his prestige gone in the country, the President lost all pretence of control of Congress, which has been dividing its time between insulting its allies, making belligerent noises at the Russians and Chinese, and adding to the dangers of both these exercises by delaying the passage of every measure designed to increase the country’s military and economic strength.

It was into this situation, which was developing so inexorably in the direction which suited them, that the Republicans threw General MacArthur, who would, they hoped, be able to administer the final blow to the groggy Administration. For a few days the Democrats behaved as if they had been hit by a blunt instrument; but first one, and then another, began to wonder whether the General was such an unalloyed godsend to the opposition. ■
