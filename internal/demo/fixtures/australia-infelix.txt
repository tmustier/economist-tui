In his discussions about the common market in Canberra this week, Mr Sandys is believed to have been twice surprised—first by the quiet attention with which his long exposition was received, and secondly by the sudden onslaught of Australian objections on the third day of the talks. Mr Sandys was unable to outline to the Australian cabinet the kind of concessions to Commonwealth exports that Britain might hope to negotiate with the common market; the explanation given here is that the Six have refused to discuss these with British ministers in advance of actual negotiations. For the present, Mr Sandys was arguing in general terms the disadvantages of remaining outside and the importance of not being a small economic unit in these days of vast ones.

The economic case was presented by the Minister for Trade, Mr John McEwan, who explained what was at stake—namely a market for £A170 million worth of Australian exports which are now sold to Britain and the Six and which would be badly hit unless special concessions could be obtained. Unlike New Zealand, whose difficulties would be confined to a few commodities, Australia would suffer over a wide range of exports. If and when detailed items of trade were discussed with the Six, Australia would expect to negotiate on its own behalf.

Mr Menzies took up the tale with the political implications, arguing that the trend towards political unity within the common market would be certain to weaken the Commonwealth relationship whose strength was already impaired by the affair of South Africa. Mr Sandys argued that declining political power would weaken the Commonwealth, too, and even—less convincingly—that closer unity in Europe might strengthen Commonwealth ties. ■
