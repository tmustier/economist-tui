Post-mortems on the presidential election in Virginia have an importance not confined to a single state. Virginia may have ceased to be the mother of presidents, but it remains the pace-setter for the entire South, where change is dissolving a once-solid Democratic allegiance. Both the trends and the inconsistencies visible in Virginia’s politics today are likely to be reproduced later in other states deeper in the South, just as Virginia’s attempt to stave off racial desegregation in the schools is being duplicated in Louisiana and Georgia.

The election in 1960 put Virginia in the Republican column for the third consecutive time. This suggests a permanent alignment with political conservatism on the part of the voters who backed the Republican presidential candidate. These results indicate that the Democratic party can hope to stop the drift in the South only by encouraging intensive new organisational efforts there, by developing new political personalities and by bringing to the polls people who do not vote at present.

Today most Southerners can cast an ideologically consistent ballot by voting for conservatives on the state level who wear the Democratic label and for conservatives on the national level who wear the Republican one. As long as the solid South provided the Democrats with a reliable block of electoral votes, the party was not disposed to find fault with this arrangement. Now that so many southern sugar plums have gone to the Republicans, more and more Democrats are having their doubts. ■
