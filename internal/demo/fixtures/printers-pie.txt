As this issue goes peacefully to press again in foreign parts, the dispute in the London printing industry continues. Some 6,000 members of the London Typographical Society (compositors and machine minders) and a few hundred members of the Association of Correctors of the Press have been out of work since February 16th, when they were dismissed for working to rule. About 10,000 other printing workers also lost their jobs a fortnight later because there was no work for them. A court of inquiry has been held, but the talks that followed the publication of its report broke down after several hours of discussion. The London printing works stay closed.

The story of the dispute that has caused our temporary exile begins last summer, when the London Society of Compositors submitted a claim for a minimum wage of £12 a week. They were getting at the time a basic rate of £7 15s which had been fixed five years before, but also a cost of living allowance which gave them an extra 1s for every point that the index rose. This had brought the minimum wage up to £9 8s. Their claim for £12 represented an increase of 27 per cent, and they justified it on two grounds: that the differential with provincial compositors should remain, and that an extra reward was due for allowing a special entry of apprentices to mitigate the shortage of manpower.

The employers replied that their final offer was 18s 6d on the basic rate of £9 8s, and that the proposals would cost £2 million directly and a further £8 million in proportionate increases to less skilled workers. Thus the argument ran from the summer into the winter until in January it reached complete deadlock. The LTS executive then instructed its members to work to rule, making production so slow and uneconomic that employers threatened dismissal. On February 15th more than 6,000 were dismissed. ■
