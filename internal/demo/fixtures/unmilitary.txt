In 1939 the United States Army, which then included the Air Force, had a total strength of about 268,000. At the end of 1951 the Army and the Air Force between them mustered 2,458,000, and by the middle of 1953 it is planned that they will have a combined strength of 3,160,000 men and women. The Defence Department is now not only the largest department of the US Government, but probably the largest single organisation in the world, and in the coming financial year the United States will spend about 70 per cent of its budget on national security. No General has been President of the United States for sixty years, yet two are now actively involved in the forthcoming presidential elections. These are only a few examples of the revolution in the relationships between the American people and their armed forces.

Before the Second World War few professions counted less in the social pattern of American life. There was no connection, as there was in Britain, between the upper middle class and a military career, and the young man of energy and independent means did not normally take up soldiering. The officer class was drawn from all levels of society under the system of nomination to West Point, and military service was confined to Washington, a string of isolated camps, and Pacific garrisons.

Has the pendulum swung in the other direction? There is no indication that soldiering has overtaken the law or any other profession in popularity. Reserve officers accept recall with duty rather than enthusiasm, the draft of 35,000 conscripts a month ranks as a major grievance, and the Army remains the most disliked service among civilians. ■
