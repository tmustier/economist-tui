After the election of 1952 the presidency made a similar move, crossing from Missouri into Kansas; Abilene, the small town where General Eisenhower grew up, is some 150 miles west of Independence, the small town where Mr Truman lives. And, when the appointments to the new Cabinet and to the various subordinate posts that have so far been filled had been studied, it became obvious that power, certainly power within the Republican party, had gone in the same direction—all the way perhaps from New York to Michigan. Just as any new President can hope to have a honeymoon with Congress, so he can also expect that the names of the men he chooses to help him in the executive branch will be greeted with deference and that all newspapers will extol their administrative talents.

There is nothing inherently immoral, and indeed nothing even unusual, about millionaires in the Cabinet. Mr Roosevelt appointed several of them and Mr Truman appointed others. The interesting point about General Eisenhower’s Cabinet is not the amount of money each of its members may have, but how and where that money was made. The General’s appointments, in fact, show how clearly he has recognised that, in the twenty years since his party left office, power has passed from the bankers to the industrialists. ■
