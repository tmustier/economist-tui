Has world disarmament drawn nearer? A fortnight ago Sir Anthony Eden and M. Mollet agreed to place it in the front rank of their preoccupations. Marshal Bulganin commented favourably on Mr Eisenhower’s latest plea for agreement on confidence-building steps that could open the door to disarmament. The Soviet premier’s attitude contrasted sharply with the crude distortions and bland evasions that made up his riposte to the President’s previous letter. Mr Stassen, the President’s chief adviser on disarmament, declared a few days later that the United States had developed a plan more acceptable to the Russians.

It is certainly true that the five-power talks which opened in London on Monday are taking place in a less rigid setting than that of earlier years. The international debate on disarmament which has gone on throughout the postwar decade had long resembled one of those conversation pieces in which every face bears a look of urgency but no figure shows any sign of movement. Until a year or so ago there was little movement. The western powers, backed by a strong majority in the United Nations, stuck to the argument that disarmament must be fairly balanced and under strict international control from the start. The Russians for their part sought to improve their military position by the most obvious means. Only twelve months ago they were sticking fast to these demands, and disarmament seemed almost infinitely remote.

It may still prove a long way off; but recent events have shortened the perspective. General acceptance of the nuclear stalemate has bred doubts about the value of less powerful weapons; all the major powers have announced cuts in their military manpower; and all are painfully aware of the economic burden of maintaining armaments that steadily grow more complex and costly. This alone is enough to account for the fact that, instead of viewing disarmament as a distant possibility, they are stepping forward to scan it more closely. ■
