The Congo’s emergence as an independent state next Thursday is a capital event in African affairs. Not even Nigeria’s appearance on October 1st can eclipse the dramatic test that M. Lumumba, his allies and his rivals are about to undergo. The grand assize is sitting. If the Congo does survive as a recognisable entity in the coming months, black Africa will consider that it has justified beyond question its capability for self-government elsewhere. If it disintegrates, as a good number of eyes covertly watching it from the south and east confidently expect it to do, the resistance to African emancipation in Africa’s remaining colonial or semi-colonial territories could stiffen into horrified rigidity.

The picture of the Congo, seen from Salisbury or Brussels this month, differs markedly from that presented at the conference of African independent states at Addis Ababa. The personal struggle between M. Lumumba and M. Kasavubu; the threats of secession from the Katanga province; the breakdown of local administration and the health and sanitation systems; the mounting evidence of a reversion to tribal division and conflict—all these serve to stimulate European expectations of disaster.

It is an image that will be confirmed in African eyes if western policy is content to wait, with arms folded, for M. Lumumba to seek his own salvation wherever he can. The Belgian record in the Congo, for all its considerable labours and successes, is sadly destined to be written off in African history as the classic example of rapacious colonialism. ■
