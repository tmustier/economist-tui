The country has entered on one of the most far-reaching industrial conflicts in history with amazing coolness. The public may demand a more complete explanation than they have yet had as to the events of the last few fateful hours and the reason for breaking off negotiations; but the Trade Union leaders must bear the main responsibility for calling into use a weapon which cannot be employed without challenging the constitutional principles in which they themselves believe. Indeed, in the present case, it is directly aimed at the Government; for if it is to succeed the Trade Unions must prove themselves strong enough to compel Parliament against its will to maintain the wages of miners on their present level at the public expense. The country can never accept such a dictatorship.

Meanwhile, the very wide response to the strike call is a testimony to the strength of Trade Union discipline, especially since the overwhelming majority of workers have ceased work with great reluctance. Numerous cases of men returning to work are reported and the declaration of the Government that men who return will be protected against victimisation may increase this tendency and mitigate some of the effects of the strike. But it is not conceivable that the fight can be maintained to the point of complete surrender and thus break the constitutional Trade Union movement. The urgent need is to find a way to resume negotiations while tempers still remain cool.

It is too soon to attempt to estimate either the direct or indirect cost to the country, but the damage will obviously increase with every day that passes. If, however, the trouble is soon over, there is no reason to fear much permanent harm and the nerves of the country may be steadier for having got rid of the menace of an unknown and unmeasured danger. ■
