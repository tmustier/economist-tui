The question is whether the steadily wealthier Britain which is the promise of every politician, and the premise of every citizen’s rising expectations, is going to be able to survive mid‑twentieth‑century competition, in the common market or out.

Mr Macmillan, as usual, has the words for it: “Britain cannot keep her present prosperity—let alone rise to higher levels—unless she can meet the growing competition in world markets.” Yet every government since 1945 has had to confess the self‑strangling process by which incomes grow faster than output, forcing growth to stop under the drag of home demand and higher costs. No government has had the guts or guile to turn the fleeting proofs of progress into a policy for growth, and the trade unions have gone on chasing the will‑o’‑the‑wisp of the biggest money wages.

The first responsibility is the Government’s: to create the conditions and incentives for competitive growth. This time Mr Selwyn Lloyd promised a pay pause, stricter control of public expenditure and a new way of planning for balanced growth, with targets set for output, exports and incomes. First the pause, then the plan—if the country is to be fit to survive. ■
