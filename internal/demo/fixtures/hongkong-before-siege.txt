It took more than a year to convince Chinese traders that the war in Europe was a world war. Until shipments from England were diverted to the Cape route, it was assumed that it was unnecessary to order replacements of stocks more than six months ahead; but when weeks elapsed without producing fresh supplies, and stocks began to melt away, a surge of buying set in. In the meantime, prices began to rise steadily, and the normal demand was swollen by buyers from other places in the Far East which were also running short of British products. The disappearance of European goods also helped to swell the demand for British manufactures, particularly piece-goods, and caused Shanghai dealers to send their buyers to Hongkong to make spot purchases.

The requirements of local industry, such as cotton yarn, woven cloth, metals and chemicals, have increased considerably. South Africa, which is now unable to buy from Japan, has been ordering on a large scale from Hongkong, and if freight space had not been so limited, much more could have been supplied. Orders from the War Supplies Board on behalf of the Eastern Group Council are filling up local manufacturers to such an extent that it is highly probable that commercial orders will have to be refused before long. But even the War Supplies Board’s requirements may not be fulfilled, as much of the supply of raw material depends upon priority decisions in London and Washington.

The arrival of a substantial force of Canadian infantry, and the possibility of further reinforcements, came as a pleasant surprise to Hongkong. The lingering anxiety on the part of some residents lest Hongkong should be sacrificed as an appeasement offering can now be set aside, and the evident determination to defend this Colony to the last will not go without notice in Tokyo—or in Chungking for that matter. ■
