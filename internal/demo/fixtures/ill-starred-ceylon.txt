The state of emergency declared last April to deal with Tamil secession continues with routine monotony, although normal conditions have been restored. Jaffna is still ruled by a military commandant and the Federal party remains proscribed, yet Tamil leaders attend parliament freely and castigate the government. They feel let down after helping the ruling Freedom party in 1960 on the understanding that Tamil would be given a reasonable place in the language policy.

If the government has recovered its balance on language, it is now attacked on all sides by enraged trade unions. The monsoon strike season has brought an island‑wide bus stoppage, threats of dock and railway strikes, and demands that have taken on a political character. Troops have moved into Colombo port as unions weigh a push toward a general strike.

Though there is something decidedly ill‑starred about Ceylon’s present state, the root cause is economic: worsening terms of trade, deficit financing and slumping external assets. The tripod of tea, rubber and coconut is shaky, and the coming year will test whether the island can find unity and development before politics collapse into crisis. ■
