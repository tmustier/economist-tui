THE Marshall Plan has only been a fortnight in Washington, yet already it begins to look as though it has come too late. The economic crisis, of which the fuel shortage in Britain in February was the first distant murmur, is flooding into Europe through every crack and culvert. The drain on Britain’s dollars has been reduced since August 20th, but it is still uncomfortably large. In Italy, the day when the last reserves will have been exhausted is hurrying forward. In France, the crisis may even break in the next fortnight—and if it does, it is not likely to be merely economic.

Meanwhile, the dry statement of Europe’s crisis—what the Paris Report amounts to—has lain for a fortnight on the tables of the officials and the politicians and the journalists of the United States. Everyone is settling down to examine it, and the examination is to be a leisurely business. The first stage is to be a detailed analysis of the actual figures by a series of experts; the results will then be compared with the “availabilities” established by the Harriman Committee.

Congress may be recalled to consider the results of these deliberations in special session early in December. Since it is felt that certain nations—the Italians, the French and the Austrians—may be in some difficulty by then, it seems likely that Congress will not consider the Paris Report as a whole even then. It may be asked to concentrate on a programme of interim aid to the three most nearly collapsing nations and the full Marshall Plan will be studied only when the normal Congressional session of 1948 opens. ■
