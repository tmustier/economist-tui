Whatever his difficulties, Mr Nehru ought not to have used violence to remove the question of Goa. Western opinion has been severe, in part because the affair exploded with suddenness. Two Indian vessels were fired on by the Portuguese and, within moments, India was demanding the instant evacuation of Goa and backing its demands with force.

The Portuguese called for international observers, and India asked for negotiations on the basis of prompt evacuation, which Portugal refused. The occupation of Goa by Indian troops began on Sunday, December 17th. Many concluded that New Delhi had manufactured the crisis to bolster popularity before the election, reasserting anti-colonialist orthodoxy after Chinese blows to its prestige.

India’s official account stresses Portuguese provocations and frontier incidents, but the lamentable fact remains: India, of all countries, has chosen to defy international law and flout its assumptions. The seizure of Goa may have been unnecessary, and it risks darkening the moral authority India has long claimed. ■
