The four-year-old Civil Rights Commission won a short new lease of life—another two years—from Congress this week just two months before it was due to go out of existence. This reprieve falls far short of the permanent status the President sought, but it is better than nothing for an Administration which has put off all other legislation dealing with civil rights until next year. The bill had to reach the floor of the Senate as a rider to an appropriations bill because, as happened two years ago, the Judiciary Committee dominated by Senator Eastland would not report it out. President Kennedy’s two new appointments to the six-man commission, one of whom is a Negro, give it a majority which favours the vigorous extension of civil rights and this does not endear it to the South.

A few days later the commission issued the first of a series of reports on the denial of civil rights. This dealt with the denial of voting rights, primarily in eight southern states where, in 109 “black belt” counties, most members of the Negro majority are prevented from going to the polls through discriminatory application of the qualifications demanded for registration and voting. The commission praised the Department of Justice for its use of the weapons given to it by the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but argued that broader legislation is necessary. ■
