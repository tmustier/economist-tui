Britain’s dependence on overseas food supplies, to cover even its basic requirements, is unique. It was willingness to accept this dependence which made Britain the world’s greatest trading power until 1914, and the most vulnerable belligerent in the two world wars of this century. This dependence greatly helped, and was in turn assisted by, the economic development of the Dominions and colonies. But until the institution of the Ottawa agreements in 1932, Britain still bought more than half of its food supplies from foreign sources. It was not, however, until the later nineteen thirties that the import pattern changed in favour of Empire countries, and the war accentuated this trend. Of the main foodstuffs listed in Table I, the Empire supplied 57 per cent of British imports in 1938; by 1946 the proportion had risen to 67 per cent, a change which was due largely, but not entirely, to the reduced scale of imports.

At the outset, it can be laid down dogmatically that the British Commonwealth cannot be self-sufficient for food supplies. The stage in examining the extent to which the Empire countries can supply Britain with food is to measure British requirements for the different items. In Table I these requirements are based on consumption and alterations in stocks have been allowed for in the import figures. The wheat figures have been recalculated in terms of flour (using average extraction rates for the periods concerned) and consumption of wheat (and also of sugar) has been taken as total disposals less exports and re-exports.

In 1946, the total consumption of all foods listed, except flour and cheese, was well below the prewar level, although the population increased by 4 per cent between 1939 and 1946. Home production of wheat for milling almost trebled during the seven-year period, and sugar output expanded by nearly 15 per cent; but production of other foodstuffs generally showed a serious fall. ■
