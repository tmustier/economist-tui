Protests from a number of maritime countries, including Great Britain, have greeted the shipping bill which Congress has just sent to the President. Its purpose is to legalise permanently the use of dual-rate contracts by shipping conferences. For forty years these voluntary groups of ocean carriers have been setting rates and giving discounts to shippers who guarantee to send their goods by conference members. This system was endangered in 1958 when a decision of the Supreme Court suggested that it contravened the American anti-trust laws, but American shipping lines have had permission to participate under interim legislation.

The objection of maritime countries is not to the underlying purpose of the measure but to a provision requiring the Federal Maritime Commission to disapprove any conference rate “so unreasonably high or low” as to be detrimental to American commerce. The bill seeks to protect American shippers and independent shipping lines, limiting the spread between contract and non-contract rates. But to domestic critics the fault is that it does not go far enough to curb alleged malpractices.

A great deal will depend on how the Federal Maritime Commission administers the measure. If the President vetoes or fails to sign the bill, American participants in shipping conferences will become vulnerable to court suits and the whole system may be thrown into confusion until new legislation can be passed next year. ■
