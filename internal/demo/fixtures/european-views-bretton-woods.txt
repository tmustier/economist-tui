The delegations of the continental Allied countries have gone to the international monetary conference at Bretton Woods after detailed discussions on the currency scheme in London. The scheme has on the whole met with approval. Their chief objection has been that the total gold and currency resources of the International Fund and the separate quotas for each member country may not be high enough to meet sharp fluctuations in balances of payment; amendments suggesting the doubling of quotas have been formulated.

Another amendment, suggested by Dutch financial experts, was that countries contributing 25 per cent of their quota in gold should be free to draw more than a 20 per cent instalment in any one year; this was eventually dropped. The main interest of most European delegates, however, is not so much the currency scheme, acceptance of which is taken for granted, as the project for an International Investment Bank which is expected to figure on the agenda.

The proposal for an International Monetary Fund is designed to solve short‑term disturbances, but most European countries will be confronted after the war with heavy tasks of reconstruction for which they will need long‑term credit. Whether such schemes will find a ready response in the United States will depend in part on whether an Investment Bank is organised as a private concern or as an agency controlled or supervised by the American administration. ■
