The chief misgiving felt about Mr Kennedy last November was that he might make mistakes of judgment, particularly in foreign policy, through exuberant self-confidence. In fact, so far he has been if anything too diffident; his one undoubted error, the decision to permit the invasion of Cuba, seems to have been committed because he lacked the self-confidence needed to overrule the experienced men who favoured military action. The chief hope he raised was that he would mould public opinion rather than conform to it, but this expectation remains largely unfulfilled.

If the President has been unexpectedly cautious, it is partly because he came into office with his foot extended for a bold step forward only to find it poised over thin air. His first weeks in the White House were marked by two major decisions: to accept a neutral government in Laos, and to negotiate seriously for a treaty banning nuclear tests. Both decisions marked an abrupt change from the policies of Mr Eisenhower. Unfortunately, Mr Khrushchev turned out to have lost interest in both of them by the time they were taken. Laos remains divided, and nuclear tests remain spectacularly unbanned.

These rebuffs have apparently qualified Mr Kennedy’s whole approach to the relationship between the communist and non-communist world. He still believes in the value of negotiating, but now regards it simply as a means of avoiding the worst dangers of a long tussle between America and Russia. ■
