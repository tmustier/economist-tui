It was announced last Tuesday that the long-awaited negotiations for a settlement of German pre-war external debts will open in London on February 28th. The approach to these discussions has been cleared by the recent agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom, France and the United States and the German Federal Government, in which the three creditor governments offered concessions in the settlement of their claims in respect of post-war economic assistance to Germany. These concessions were conditional upon the reaching of an equitable settlement of the pre-war debts.

The coming conference will seek such a settlement, and will be under the direction of the Tripartite Commission on German Debts, which has extended invitations to representatives of twenty-seven of the interested governments and to the Bank for International Settlements. It will attempt to settle on an international scale both the public and private indebtedness of Germany—indebtedness comprising the direct obligations of the Reich, the Potash loans, standstill credits, some municipal loans, and a small amount of private and commercial claims.

Germany has been in default on the Dawes and Young loans since 1939, and Herr Adenauer has now recognised responsibility for these liabilities, subject to certain reservations about Germany’s ability to raise and transfer the service on the bonds. The negotiations will have to balance those reservations against the principle of equal treatment for bondholders, irrespective of nationality, without regard to concessions made under Nazi pressure. ■
