The proposal for an International Monetary Fund is designed to solve short‑term disturbances in the balances of payment of member countries. Most European countries, however, will be confronted after the war with heavy tasks of reconstruction for which they will need the assistance of long‑term credit. Some governments have already made approximate calculations of their need for foreign reconstruction loans.

The Polish Government, for instance, has submitted a broad investment scheme in Washington: a ten‑year programme of industrialisation with a $2 billion loan paid in annual instalments of $200 million. The scheme provides an interesting contrast to Poland’s pre‑war policy, which was directed toward eliminating foreign capital from Polish industries. Whether such ambitious schemes will find a ready response in the United States remains to be seen.

The prospects will depend in part on whether the proposed International Investment Bank is organised as a strictly private concern or as an agency controlled or supervised by the American administration. A private concern would leave the flow of credits exposed to changing moods and calculations; public management might provide a steadier rate of investment, since political risks deter the private investor more than the public one. ■
