The events around Elizabethville seem less dramatic here than they did a week ago in Europe. The Katanga question has provoked only a minor student demonstration, and Mr Tshombe is seen by Mr Adoula and General Mobutu as no more of a “secessionist” than Mr Gizenga. Everyone knows the Republic of the Congo, far from being unifiable in any current constitutional sense, can develop harmoniously only if it is first subdivided into twelve or fourteen compartments, instead of the present ex‑Belgian six. The intelligible African fact is that King Leopold II’s former estate is the scene of an experiment in, usually gentle, anarchy. Africa will “jell” in its own good time. Just now it is liquid.

The Congo has now definitely replaced Ethiopia as the world’s leading surrealist country. It is the place with no budget, which has lost between 50 and 75 per cent of its exports but has had only a 30 per cent inflation. It is the territory where 50 per cent of government expenditure is on the large salaries of civil and military officials, and where the Leopoldville working class still earns what it did when the Congo was Africa’s richest colony. ■
