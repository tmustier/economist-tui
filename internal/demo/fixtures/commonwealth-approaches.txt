What was planned as a two‑day meeting between Mr Heath and the ministers of the Six finished after one day. In that time they found mutually acceptable solutions to difficulties of principle and sent the working parties back to marshal statistics before the next ministerial debate.

One sticking point had been whether Britain could authorise a study of the effect of adopting the common external tariff on Commonwealth imports. Mr Heath agreed to a purely exploratory study provided it implied no pre‑judgment. Another dispute was whether to study Commonwealth problems by region or by product. M. Jean Francois Deniau proposed a middle way.

The Deniau proposal divides Commonwealth problems into four categories based on principal export products, ranging from those harmed by the common external tariff to those affected by the common agricultural policy. Its limitations were acknowledged, but it was accepted as a useful synthesis for navigating a forest of statistics. ■
