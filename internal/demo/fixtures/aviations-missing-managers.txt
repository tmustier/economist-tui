Here is a time for belabouring the aircraft industry and a time for offering it a helping hand. Currently it needs help. It will mount an air show before the faithful Farnborough pilgrims and before a hundred pairs of expert eyes from Canada and the United States. These visitors will see the industry at perhaps its lowest ebb for 25 years, in terms of clear ideas for future development as distinct from work on established equipment.

For the future health of the aircraft industry, someone should be looking now at the industry we have and at its customers, deciding what aircraft can be built with the resources available and to whom they could be sold. Here the average industrialist would snort and say this is a job for management. But managers are precisely the people that the aircraft industry lacks. It has an abundance of planners, designers, innovators, production engineers, salesmen and the occasional genius, but it is thin on the organising men who translate genius into output.

There is one remedy for this: the men in charge of Britain’s five main aircraft groups should be looking round for heirs to groom for succession. The mergers formed groups with resources adequate for modern aircraft production, but they also produced a surplus of senior executives, making it hard to find room near the top for the new management blood the industry needs. ■
