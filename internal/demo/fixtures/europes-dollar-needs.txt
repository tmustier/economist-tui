Much is made in the general report of the Committee of European Economic Co-operation on European self-help and economic integration, and chapter 3 is optimistically littered with production targets designed to breathe conviction into these hopes. But on the estimates of Europe’s balance of payments the report comes down to more solid realities. Its essence is an appeal to the United States for assistance in a task of rehabilitation which could not be attempted on the scale here set out without that assistance.

Chapter 7 of the report, which deals with the problem of payments, offers estimates of the scale of assistance which is needed. It may be possible to quarrel with the data on which these estimates have been made, including the somewhat optimistic assumptions about the future behaviour of the terms of trade.

The assumption is that export prices will remain unchanged at current levels until the end of 1951, the period for which the estimates are made. For import prices the assumptions are that as compared with levels ruling on July 1, 1947, there will be no change in 1948, but that falls will later occur of 7½ per cent in 1949, 10 per cent in 1950, and 12½ per cent in 1951. What matters is not that each of these views of the level of export and import prices respectively must be realised, but that the relative movement between the two series of prices should produce this net result. The basic assumption on this score, at least as far as the immediate future is concerned, would seem to err decidedly on the side of optimism. ■
