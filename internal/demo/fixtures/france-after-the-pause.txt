Some of the interest in French planning has been inspired as much by France’s wages freeze of 1958–59 as by the plans themselves. In fact the pay pause had nothing to do with planning, and by the time it was quoted abroad it had already gone with the boom. Over the last two years French wage rates have been rising at more than 1.8 per cent a quarter, leaving the authorities less confident that they can combine rapid expansion with price stability.

The link between the pay pause and planning is imaginary. The planning institutions were at work throughout the postwar period without preventing inflation. The pause came from recession and political change: the end of the Fourth Republic, divided unions, and austerity after the 1958 devaluation. Industrial workers bore the main burden of the recovery.

As production picked up, the labour market tightened and concessions returned. Employers in expanding sectors shared gains rather than face strikes, and by late 1959 the pause was effectively over. Wages rose faster in 1961 than the government hoped, and unrest in nationalised industries now threatens renewed conflict. ■
