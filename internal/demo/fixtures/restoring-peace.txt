The general strike, after lasting nearly nine days (7½ working days), to which must be added some days of confused aftermath, came to an abrupt conclusion at mid-day on Wednesday by the statement of the Trades Union Congress to the Prime Minister that they were issuing orders for a return to work forthwith. The withdrawal was unconditional, but the Trade Union leaders stated that they relied upon the statements of the Prime Minister as to the basis on which the coal negotiations could be reopened.

Before the end of the first week it had become increasingly evident that the Trades Union Congress, by inducing millions of trade unionists who only wished to show their sympathy with the miners to break their contracts and render themselves liable to damages and permanent loss of employment, had raised a grave constitutional issue in regard to which the overwhelming opinion of the country, including that of most trade unionists themselves, was that if it were pushed to a conclusion the Government must win—or the nation would be plunged into civil strife, which none but a few extremists desired, and the end of which no one could foresee.

This realisation in labour circles was strengthened by the increasing success of the Government’s emergency measures. Within a very few days, therefore, the labour leaders were earnestly seeking a line of retreat. ■
