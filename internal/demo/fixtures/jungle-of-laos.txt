The Laotian situation is as messy as any of those that will land in the lap of the new President of the United States. Laos must be infinitely frustrating to American policy-makers. Since the Laotian kingdom emerged independent from the Geneva conference of 1954, American taxpayers have poured $40 million to $50 million a year into it; the two or three million Laotians have been more favoured by economic benevolence, in terms of dollars per head, than almost any other recipients. This aid has made individual fortunes, but has left little of more permanent value than the consumer durables amassed by Laotian politicians.

Eighty or ninety per cent of the aid has gone in weapons and training for the army, and towards the wages of soldiers and civil servants. The purpose of this sustained effort has been to guard Laos from communism. Yet today, Laos, divided and confused as never before, is in greater danger than ever of being taken over by the communists; and if Seato intervenes, the operation could succeed but leave the patient dead.

It is now desperately late to put things right, but the attempt must be made. The Geneva agreements of 1954 left only Cambodia in possession of its entire national territory. In Laos, the guerrillas of the communist-led Pathet Lao were allowed to remain in occupation of the two north-eastern provinces pending a political settlement. The Pathet Lao, a state within the state, had set up an administration in the two provinces under Vietnamese communist guidance. ■
