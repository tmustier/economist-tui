Paris provided spring weather in December for this week’s diplomatic festival, when the foreign ministers of the three principal western powers, joined by their German colleague, set to work. The meetings multiplied—Nato council, the Western European Union, the Common Market ministers—but the German question dominated all the others.

“Berlin über Alles” was the main tune of the December festival, and it was not performed harmoniously. Was the Paris meeting meant to produce a concrete platform for negotiations with the Russians, to obtain General de Gaulle’s blessing for further probing in Moscow, or merely to preserve a semblance of allied unity while real decisions were taken elsewhere? The answer matters because the crisis in Berlin has become the test of western cohesion.

The familiar image of fourteen negotiators foiled by a solitary stubborn Frenchman is too simple. Dr Adenauer has never been fond of talks with the Russians, while General de Gaulle’s vision of grandeur leaves no room for American leadership. The argument between procedure and substance runs straight through the alliance, and the unresolved question—whether France will join negotiations—hangs over every attempt to settle Berlin. ■
