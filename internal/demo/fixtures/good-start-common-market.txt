In Britain, where the common market battle has been raging for months, it is clear enough that the Government has made up its mind to join the European community and do its best to make it work. On the Continent, not everyone has got the message yet. Mr Heath’s main task in Paris, when he expounded the British position to the council of ministers of the Six, was to deliver it as forcefully as possible. A look at French press comment on this preliminary round suggests that he has had a creditable success.

Two parts of his speech, in particular, seemed to impress his hearers: acceptance of a common agricultural policy, and willingness to share in arrangements for political co-operation which the Six set in train at their July meeting in Bonn. It is in agriculture that France’s economic interests are most immediately at stake. The political arrangements are important to all the Six: “We are not in business, we are in politics.”

The detail of Mr Heath’s statement, and the clear acceptance of so much common ground with the Six, ought to mean that the full-scale meetings planned for November can get down quickly to serious negotiation about the knotty trade problems of the Commonwealth. ■
