The Tunisians have a taste for peace and peacemaking. They see themselves as the Swedes or Swiss of Africa, and in that character offer themselves to the world. Lately they have given Mr Mongi Slim to be president of the United Nations General Assembly and Mr Mahmoud Khiari to speak for the United Nations in the talks with Mr Tshombe that produced a Katanga cease-fire. Though they boast but a small army, they were among the first countries to contribute to the UN force in the Congo and to promise a contribution to the Arab League force in Kuwait. Then why, ask their critics, could they not in July this year have kept their own peace at Bizerta?

Only a glance down the years of Tunisia’s independence can uncover an answer—and with it the true Bizerta. This was the base that President Bourguiba intended as his small country’s chief contribution to the defence of the West. It wore the bright face of an offering designed to win French goodwill, though one that became crestfallen as gift horses looked in the mouth are apt to become.

When Tunisia gained independence in 1956, Tunisia asked that Bizerta might join the NATO system of bases. The NATO powers merely shrugged and France would not hear of the idea. So, rejected as a contributor to NATO, President Bourguiba proposed a western Mediterranean defence pact in which France might still be caretaker of Bizerta but Tunisia would be a full member. Again the French frowned, and the two countries begged to differ over sovereignty while not pressing the issue for fear of embarrassing France while it was involved in the Algerian war. ■
