The great day has passed without any untoward events. The Treasury did not find it possible to complete the full series of arrangements to make currently earned sterling a freely transferable currency by July 15th. That was due partly to the immensity of the task and the unbelievably small expert staff, but prodigies of effort overcame most obstacles. The greater gaps remain because other parties were unwilling to enter agreements or because economic chaos made such deals out of court. Important arrangements with India and Iraq had not been completed by July 15th, but interim arrangements were expected within days.

Of the countries outside transferability agreements the most interesting is Switzerland, which has persistently refused to enter any such arrangements. The essence of the agreements is that countries should accept sterling from others and transfer sterling for current transactions. Switzerland will accept foreign currency only under bilateral arrangements where it controls the exchange it accumulates. Aside from this, a large group of countries lack effective governments or face such chaos that agreements are impractical—China, Paraguay, Rumania, Bulgaria, Greece, Jugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Japan and Korea among them. Russia, France, Denmark and Turkey were still under discussion, and the American authorities extended the deadline to September 15th.

It should not be assumed that this large group lies outside free transferability of sterling. Criticisms from the United States assume discriminatory trade, but that is mistaken. There is no reason why sterling held by these countries should not be granted full convertibility by administrative action in cases justified on their merits, and the intention in Britain is to grant such administrative convertibility wherever formal arrangements are incomplete. ■
