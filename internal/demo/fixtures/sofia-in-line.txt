Mr Vulko Chervenkov’s dismissal from his post of deputy prime minister completes the fall from grace of the man once known as Bulgaria’s “little Stalin.” His decline has been long and gradual, beginning in 1956 when he lost the premiership after the reaction against Stalinism, yet he remained in the politburo and retained influence behind the scenes.

Mr Khrushchev’s renewed attacks on Stalin at the 22nd Soviet party congress in October landed Mr Chervenkov in fresh trouble, and on November 30th his expulsion from the politburo was announced. In a lengthy report Mr Zhivkov said it was necessary to overcome completely Chervenkov’s personality cult, which did not correspond to his actual services. Now the process is complete and Chervenkov has been dropped from government altogether.

Whether he has lost all influence remains to be seen, but Bulgaria’s current leaders have clearly aligned themselves publicly with Khrushchev’s line, distancing themselves from Stalin and from Albania’s defiance. Sofia is, for the moment, in line. ■
