The shock administered to world opinion by the big Soviet test explosion has made the high-handed decision of the United States government to circle the world with a band of copper needles seem a mere pinprick; still, it is a mighty irritating one to anyone with a professional interest in space. The needles, 75 pounds of fine copper hairs scattered in an orbit 2,000 miles high, are the prototype of a new, possibly interference-free, system of military radio communication.

But if they work as planned and reflect signals transmitted from earth back to receivers on the ground, astronomers fear they will work equally well in reverse and deflect back into space the light and radio signals from far galaxies which they are attempting to record. The experiment was modified to meet furious protests, yet many remain uneasy about its consequences, especially when the needles are likely to remain in space for at least seven years and possibly longer.

It is an alarming demonstration of the ability of a small body of scientists to cause inconvenience to their colleagues generally. Some international forum to co-ordinate experiments in space seems needed if similar incidents are to be avoided in future. ■
