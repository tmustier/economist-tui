A short bout of impatience in Paris has brought Mr Bevin diplomatic results which months of patience towards the Russians failed to achieve. Western Europe now has, after five days’ work, what is virtually a standing economic committee. Not only is Britain a member, but it is on Britain’s leadership that its success largely depends. It would never have existed had Mr Bevin pounced on a paragraph of Mr Marshall’s Harvard speech of June 5th and hustled the European governments into conference.

It will not survive unless the British interest is whole‑hearted and intelligent. To revive a war‑worn metaphor, it means that Britain has to work its passage back to prosperity through American favour, in company with fifteen other nations, plus western Germany. It means that the European governments who need American aid have been marshalled into a queue in which Britain’s place is uncertain. It means that the main objective of American economic policy abroad is now not to meet British needs, but to promote a general European recovery from which Britain can only benefit if it works, sacrifices and plans as hard as the French, the Dutch and the Belgians.

The Paris conference on economic co‑operation, thanks largely to British leadership and French tact, has polished off the first part of its task in a weekend. When it met last Saturday, only five weeks had passed since Mr Marshall issued his challenge to the governments of Europe to get together, take stock, present a balance sheet and offer a plan for using further American credits and aid. Those five weeks have seen Mr Molotov dismissing the American offer and the governments of eastern Europe following his lead. A working organisation is now in place, but Washington has signalled that no plan to aid Europe will reach Congress until next year. ■
