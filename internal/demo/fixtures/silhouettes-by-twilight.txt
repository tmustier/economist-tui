In the grey penumbra of the international conference on the future of Laos, the greatest difficulty is to find enough shadows to enable the current bout of shadow-boxing to continue for as long as may be necessary. By twilight, shadow-boxing is more than usually strenuous, so the sixteen delegations—including three Laotian ones—though they show willing by meeting nearly every weekday, seem tacitly agreed to limit sessions to about an hour a day. That there is a need to prolong the bout is tacitly agreed; just as it was hard to get the conference off the ground in the first place, so it is hard to get to grips in the absence of a single, representative and recognised Laotian government.

Indeed, if the presence of three delegations, representing the right-wing Boun Oum government, the neutralist Souvanna Phouma one and the Communist Pathet Lao movement, is taken as an example of the troika principle in action, then it has provided a useful demonstration of its futility. Widely, but prematurely, it was assumed that the three rival princes meant what they said when they met at Zurich last month and announced agreement on the procedure for forming a government of national unity. Since then, however, the participants have gone their separate ways. ■
