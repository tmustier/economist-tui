DISCUSSION of the North Atlantic Pact in the United States and western Europe has lost no time in moving beyond the practical problems that must arise after it has been signed on April 4th. It has fastened already on the wording of its fourth article, which can be read to imply that its signatories might consult about a threat to their security arising from events outside as well as inside Europe. It has ranged far from the Atlantic area into speculation about regional pacts in the Pacific, in the Indian Ocean, and in the Mediterranean.

Now that the first bold plunge into regional security arrangements has been taken by America, Canada, the countries of the Brussels Pact and Norway, other nations are tempted to do the same. A movement of ideas is under way which must profoundly influence the strategic—even perhaps the constitutional—arrangements of the British Commonwealth. Regional defence and consultation are no novelty for the Dominions. What is new, indeed revolutionary, is the fact that one of them—Canada—has taken a leading part in working out a document so binding and so formal as the new pact.

It is obvious that the signing of the pact on April 4th will be a turning point in the history of the British Commonwealth. For Canada has been led by its common strategic interest with the United States to undertake, at the side of this country, peacetime commitments in Europe which are without precedent in the history of the Dominions. ■
